WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.597
The next words are about global
and Taiwan environmental issues

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:10.724
Then the global word is nothing more than what everyone has often heard
from before to now is the greenhouse effect and the hole in the ozone layer.

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.569
Little is known about the spread
of hazardous industrial waste

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.893
Everyone mainly knows that
greenhouse gases rise and then cause

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.885
Destruction of the balance
of biological ecology

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.375
That's roughly the case

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:26.609
In terms of Taiwan, the main
problem for us in Taiwan is that

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:33.268
The reason why the waste is dumped indiscriminately is
because the land in Taiwan is narrow and densely populated.

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:35.753
Then there is

00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.918
There is no way to deal with
a lot of waste, which leads to

00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:41.113
Many manufacturers collect

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.841
Business waste of each household
or garbage of the general public

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.287
To save these costs then go

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:49.626
Without the treatment of the equipment

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:51.095
then go mess

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.741
The current situation in Taiwan is

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.683
Dumping waste and looting sand and gravel

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:03.474
The illegal mining of sand and gravel will cause
some damage to the soil and ecological problems.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.751
I've been paying more
attention to this one recently.

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:13.984
Then we now see that there is
a picture with two pictures above

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.288
This drawing of him

00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:19.360
this one

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:28.064
The words here are mainly like this one

00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:30.624
this one

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:40.352
The second photo is the one on the bridge
and the last one is also the main one

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:46.752
Near the bridgehead, there are a
lot of unscrupulous businessmen.

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:53.152
Receive some rubbish littering
this piece this photo is in that

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:54.883
Qiaotou's pen show community

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:56.576
If there are residents nearby

00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:01.827
If our employees live there, I
don't know if you know this place.

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:08.157
In this case, there are some unscrupulous businessmen
who take over the waste of public institutions.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.352
If it is not processed and then placed directly
here, the scope of his influence is quite large.

00:02:12.608 --> 00:02:14.912
Then let's watch the movie

00:04:54.399 --> 00:05:01.351
If the comparison bridge just
now is here, if the waste is dumped

00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:06.869
This is which manufacturer to look for, that is,
if the institution entrusts this manufacturer

00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:13.033
To clean the waste stream of sludge, if this
waste manufacturer disposes of it indiscriminately

00:05:13.058 --> 00:05:15.839
If the EPA catches it,
it will be pushed back

00:05:15.864 --> 00:05:20.803
Including business units and processing units
and removal units are subject to penalties

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:26.143
Then this piece of land is going to go
through everyone, that is, there will be a

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:28.959
Jointly delegated responsibility here

00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:37.471
Whoever caused the accident is responsible and who has to pay
to deal with it, so there are still more problems in Taiwan.

00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:44.575
The concept of environmental protection is to
reduce why there are environmental regulations

00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:50.975
In order to protect the environment,
the main thing is to reduce that

00:05:51.231 --> 00:05:57.375
To reduce or avoid the burden and harm of the environment,
it is necessary to take some measures and behaviors

00:05:57.631 --> 00:06:03.775
The first is to rule out environmental damage that has
occurred or to mitigate the damage that has occurred

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:10.175
The one that is harmful, let him reduce some of
the harmfulness, and then take some precautions

00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:16.575
measures for the improvement of the future
environment that ultimately achieves that environment

00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:18.431
and sustainable development of resources

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:26.815
The word in this one is that Errenxi.
Do you know where Errenxi is?

00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:30.490
Or the Errenxi Incident or
the Green Oyster Incident

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.940
Does anyone know? Yes,
some people just nod their heads.

00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:39.615
Because of this piece, he is the
same as before in Taiwan in the 1970s

00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:46.015
In 2009, Taiwan happened to be developing economically, and
then it happened to be searching for some foreign countries.

00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:52.415
Scrap metal scraps were used to
make some heavy metals in the refining.

00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:58.815
The equipment and technology have not developed yet, so the
current unscrupulous businessman is directly in that Errenxi

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:05.215
At the junction of Tainan and Kaohsiung, there is an
Erren Stream directly on the riverside for cleaning.

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:11.615
To extract heavy metals, after refining
heavy metals, if you burn them, you will

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:18.015
He released heavy metals and some poisons
directly in the river to do some cleaning

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:24.415
Then over time, the green oysters will absorb
these heavy metals and become green oysters.

00:07:24.671 --> 00:07:25.695
That

00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:33.119
After this one stream has been
polluted by these heavy metals so far

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:39.519
It is still very serious because many harmful
substances cause the entire surrounding environment

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:45.919
The damaged one is the current one that he is
still doing sorting out and the current one.

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:50.783
The condition of Houjinxi is similar.

00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:53.855
Now is

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:56.671
Mainly this problem

00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:04.607
That is, Taiwan is developing now, and
sustainable development is because of the current

00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:11.007
Are all resources taken from nature?
Then the resources will be exhausted.

00:08:11.263 --> 00:08:12.543
How to go

00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:18.105
Prevention of this problem used to be a linear
economy and now it is to promote a circular economy

00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:25.343
Then what is linear economy, I will talk about
the number of the one in this picture later.

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:31.743
If the resources will be left to the next generation, this one
is the fastest at present, and then in 100 years, the whole

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:37.375
If there are heavy metals, there is
absolutely no such thing, so now I put some

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:43.007
Reusable waste bag reuse
reduces economic exhaustion

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:51.711
This is a schematic diagram of the cycle between
the linear economy and the circular economy.

00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:57.855
In the past, the raw
materials came directly

00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:05.535
After the raw materials are obtained, the resources
are added to the production and then consumed

00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:11.935
After consumption, give it to consumers to use,
and then throw it away after consumers use it

00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:16.287
There is no action to reuse at
all, and the current promotion is

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:24.223
After the produced product is
used by the consumer, it is made into

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:30.623
Recycling and recycling do the action of refining separately
and then the current situation of the economic zone

00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:41.887
In terms of sustainable development, the revolving
fund he talked about, in terms of NXP, our current

00:09:42.143 --> 00:09:44.703
raw material for some waste

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.775
There are currently

00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:54.687
The waste compression molding glue goes to some
of the manufacturers to do the recycling and then

00:09:54.943 --> 00:10:01.087
Doing that Portland cement is like that

00:10:01.343 --> 00:10:04.159
The kind of concrete on the road

00:10:05.183 --> 00:10:11.327
Then or like the plastic that the company
currently produces is to do it twice

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:14.399
A plastic particle prepared
for the second time

00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:16.447
to reuse

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:26.431
If the EPA's policy on that environment is
related to the law just mentioned, this is

00:10:26.687 --> 00:10:32.831
There is an air pollution law, a water pollution
law, a waste disposal law, and a noise control law.

00:10:33.087 --> 00:10:39.231
In fact, there are quite a number of laws and regulations, and they are
mainly aimed at these items, which are closely related to factories.

00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:47.423
Air pollution prevention and control

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:53.823
By definition, there is one or more pollutants
or mixtures in the outdoor atmosphere that cause

00:10:54.079 --> 00:11:00.223
Affect the life and property of humans, animals
and plants, and unreasonably interfere with people

00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:08.000
There are two types of air pollution: one is a mobile source
of pollution, and the second is a fixed source of pollution.

00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:13.023
Mobile pollution sources are nothing
more than cars, motorcycles and trains.

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:18.655
Stationary pollution sources are the more common ones, which are the
stationary pollution sources of some wastes emitted by factories.

00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:25.567
If these pollution sources are to be discharged, they
will have to go through some equipment and technologies.

00:11:25.823 --> 00:11:26.943
Go out and make improvements

00:11:27.615 --> 00:11:29.151
then reach 1

00:11:29.407 --> 00:11:31.711
Only qualified range values
​​can be used for emissions

00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:40.415
If the company is concerned, the waste of the company
is mainly due to the gaseous pollutants and the

00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:46.815
Particulate pollutants and toxic
pollutants which gases are that

00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:53.215
How to deal with sulfide sulfur
oxides, sulfuric acid and sodium nitrate

00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:54.751
that scrubber

00:11:55.007 --> 00:12:01.151
The principle of the scrubber is to use physical
absorption and chemical absorption to have that gas

00:12:01.407 --> 00:12:07.551
Solubility in liquid dissolve
some gas in that water and do

00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:11.903
The action of the cycle washes the
contaminants down, and after the fine wash

00:12:12.415 --> 00:12:18.559
The clean gas is discharged, and the discharge is what
you want to discharge, if you want to deal with that

00:12:18.815 --> 00:12:22.951
Regulations define the
standard that can discharge

00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:30.079
If you are caught by the
EPA, you will be fined directly

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:40.760
As you just said about the emission of exhaust gas, the Environmental
Protection Agency will set some emission standards for that.

00:12:40.784 --> 00:12:46.145
And fixed pollution source permit system
to set up automatic continuous monitoring

00:12:46.192 --> 00:12:48.256
That automatic continuous
monitoring is to detect that

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.655
How much waste does the equipment in
your factory emit and then there is another

00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.471
the amount of pollutants and then go

00:12:57.727 --> 00:13:01.567
charge some fees to control

00:13:03.871 --> 00:13:10.015
His words are that the waste
is closely related to everyone.

00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:16.415
This is the general residents and people will produce
some waste that the definition of waste is to say

00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:24.351
Abandoned, or the one that
was originally unusable or that

00:13:24.607 --> 00:13:30.751
He has been unable to use the existing technology or the
economic value without the market to do it again and again.

00:13:31.007 --> 00:13:35.970
There are two types of
recycling called waste.

00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:40.223
One is general waste and
the other is business waste

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:46.623
General waste is waste other than
business waste What is business waste?

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:50.463
The factory that is open

00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:56.863
Industrial waste can be divided
into harmful and harmless

00:13:57.119 --> 00:14:03.263
That is, there are hazardous industrial waste and general
industrial waste Hazardous industrial waste for each

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:09.663
The first characteristic of the waste
is the PH value or its ignition point.

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:10.943
Classification

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:14.527
or heavy metal content

00:14:18.623 --> 00:14:24.767
How to remove some of the waste produced by the
factory? The Environmental Protection Agency

00:14:25.023 --> 00:14:31.167
There are also some laws and regulations
to be done to ask for how to do it.

00:14:31.423 --> 00:14:37.567
Effectively disposing of business
units is NXP's garbage in terms of NXP

00:14:37.823 --> 00:14:43.967
will process or reuse this part

00:14:44.223 --> 00:14:50.367
There are self-processing and joint processing, and clearing
processing is also entrusted. The current situation here

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:55.999
They are all entrusting the removal manufacturer and
the processing manufacturer to do some legal actions.

00:14:56.255 --> 00:14:58.815
Then these words will go through some

00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:03.167
other competent authority

00:15:03.423 --> 00:15:05.727
Supervision

00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:09.567
action requested

00:15:10.965 --> 00:15:16.991
If this is garbage, if the garbage
bag factory is cleared out, it will be

00:15:18.015 --> 00:15:24.159
This factory needs a clean-up plan and an Internet
declaration of garbage to go out is to do Internet

00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:30.559
The online declaration will link to the EPA website
and see how much your company produces every day

00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:36.959
She will keep track of how much rubbish and how much rubbish to remove,
to avoid saying that some unscrupulous businessmen will take some rubbish

00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:43.359
I cleaned it out and then I didn't follow the rules
and discarded it indiscriminately, just like that

00:15:43.615 --> 00:15:49.759
The situation in the pen show community in
Qiaotou will be completely unknown, so he will

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:51.551
against

00:15:52.575 --> 00:15:58.719
Business units, clearing manufacturers and processing manufacturers will
make an online declaration plus clearing manufacturers if they are in

00:15:58.975 --> 00:16:05.119
After NXP cleared the garbage, he went out
to the factory and asked for a GPS tracking

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:11.519
He will check whether this route has been properly
dealt with after reaching the disposal site.

00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:17.919
The processing is divided into the entrusted processing
and joint processing that everyone is talking about.

00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:22.527
And reusing cross-border
processing is something like

00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:29.183
Taiwan's garbage is sent to third countries or
other countries for disposal, just like that

00:16:29.439 --> 00:16:35.583
The Errenxi incident is
the situation in Taiwan.

00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:40.001
Receive garbage from European
and American countries for removal

00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:42.239
have these three

00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:53.606
If the waste removal business unit wants to remove
waste, it must set up the waste person in charge

00:16:53.806 --> 00:16:59.078
Then in NXP, there is
a third item in this and

00:16:59.135 --> 00:17:04.767
Item 4, Item 5 and Item 6 should
be assigned special personnel

00:17:05.535 --> 00:17:08.351
to control, manage and supervise

00:17:09.887 --> 00:17:16.031
This article is the criterion for the determination of a
considerable duty of care for business entrustment and clean-up

00:17:16.287 --> 00:17:22.431
That rule is based on 30 rules. If something like the
one just now is thrown away, then tell him about it.

00:17:22.687 --> 00:17:28.831
Institutions, removal manufacturers and processing manufacturers
must be jointly and severally responsible for removal

00:17:29.087 --> 00:17:35.231
Then this cost is all business units. For example, if NXP
entrusts a manufacturer to dispose of it indiscriminately

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:39.301
If the inspection department of the
Environmental Protection Agency comes to find out

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:46.495
If you go to the source to check, including NXP and
the removal manufacturer, you must go to the site

00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:49.311
take care of the land

00:17:51.615 --> 00:17:54.175
There are also some penalties here.

00:17:58.527 --> 00:18:04.671
That is before the cleaning of the business
unit if the garbage is to be removed

00:18:04.927 --> 00:18:11.071
Do some classified storage
and self-inspection in the factory

00:18:11.327 --> 00:18:17.471
If there is a special person to do it, we need to
ask each unit to do a good job in classification.

00:18:17.727 --> 00:18:24.715
If the action is not properly classified, it will cause
the removal of the manufacturer to clear out the problem.

00:18:25.151 --> 00:18:31.295
This is the source business, that is, the business
unit. If you are looking for the removal manufacturer

00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:35.685
When the cleanup is done, a
written contract will be written.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:43.710
The written contract should be very detailed, including whether the manufacturer
you are looking for has the technology to handle it or whether he has the equipment

00:18:44.351 --> 00:18:46.143
capable of doing these actions

00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:53.567
Properly dispose of after clearing you have to
provide one he provides one to dispose of properly

00:18:53.823 --> 00:18:58.687
Clearing the file will bring
the EPA for future reference

00:19:05.343 --> 00:19:11.487
The specification for the removal and disposal
of industrial waste storage means that

00:19:11.743 --> 00:19:17.887
The same is that you can't let my garbage fly when
you suddenly add your garbage bags for storage

00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:24.287
or spills, seeps or contaminates
the ground or emits a foul odor

00:19:24.543 --> 00:19:27.871
Air pollution laws are affected
by flying and spreading odor

00:19:28.127 --> 00:19:33.566
seeps the water that pollutes the ground that
trashes his impact on pollution regulations

00:19:33.591 --> 00:19:38.367
These are closely related and more
troublesome, so it is better to store them

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:45.023
Including your garbage storage, you have to go through
whether it has compatibility or not. What is compatibility?

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:51.423
That is, if two different substances are
mixed together, will some explosions occur?

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:54.495
Hazardous gases, be careful with these

00:19:54.751 --> 00:20:00.895
The storage location is the same, and the
container facilities must be marked in Chinese.

00:20:01.407 --> 00:20:07.551
Discarders do a good job of distinguishing
not to cause incompatibility or that

00:20:07.807 --> 00:20:10.367
There are some problems with garbage

00:20:11.903 --> 00:20:17.791
The prevention and control of hazardous industrial waste is almost
the same as the storage regulations for general industrial waste.

00:20:22.399 --> 00:20:28.543
If he looks at the photo,
he thinks it's actually fine

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:32.127
But this is actually he

00:20:32.895 --> 00:20:34.175
1 box is how many inches

00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:41.313
This is an organic solvent, which
organic solvent, you empty the bucket

00:20:42.749 --> 00:20:45.183
In terms of occupational safety law

00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:48.767
If there is solvent in it, use a drain pan

00:20:49.023 --> 00:20:55.167
The one from the anti-leakage treatment plant is
already empty, but why is this one still needed?

00:20:55.423 --> 00:21:01.567
Take it out and tell everyone about it
because he still has some residual fluid in it

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:07.967
This piece is considered hazardous industrial waste
because it is the organic solvent or the organic solvent.

00:21:08.223 --> 00:21:12.319
If the flash point is
greater than 60 degrees

00:21:12.575 --> 00:21:18.208
He is classified in Hazardous
Industrial Waste He can't be like this

00:21:18.464 --> 00:21:22.304
He's trying to tell
him that it can't be that

00:21:23.578 --> 00:21:29.728
Dispose of it indiscriminately, or
paste that Chinese sign to sort it out.

00:21:32.032 --> 00:21:35.104
This one is that one

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.456
If this picture is an environmental
protection cockroach, it is hypothetical

00:21:39.712 --> 00:21:45.856
The family here has land, or that
house is to be rented out to others

00:21:46.112 --> 00:21:52.256
Pay attention to your own safety. Some
people will rent it out after renting it.

00:21:52.512 --> 00:21:59.374
Accept some waste and then dispose of it indiscriminately.
If it is found here, the landlord must deal with it.

00:21:59.399 --> 00:22:05.543
The removal of the manufacturer in
the business unit has to do the removal.

00:22:05.568 --> 00:22:07.872
Take a look at the video

00:25:16.032 --> 00:25:22.176
Like he just said, a garbage
is cleared out and he charges

00:25:22.432 --> 00:25:28.576
20,000 to 30,000 He will litter the
garbage in order to save this money

00:25:28.832 --> 00:25:34.976
If it is found that there is some joint
responsibility, including the landlord and that

00:25:35.232 --> 00:25:41.376
The total money for clearing and transporting manufacturers
is tens of millions. Many manufacturers do this for this

00:25:41.632 --> 00:25:47.776
It is the processing fee, which is to spend
equipment to process and save this little money

00:25:48.032 --> 00:25:49.824
turn into spending the big bucks

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:56.224
At present, there are quite a lot of these situations
in Taiwan, but how to catch them can't be done because

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.624
It is very profitable to do waste

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:09.024
How much is to be received in a month and do not need
to be dealt with, then there are many such problems.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.424
That's why the garbage we just mentioned is
cleared out, and many GPS homes don't check it.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:21.312
There are only a few people in the inspection
department of so many environmental protection bureaus.

00:26:21.568 --> 00:26:27.712
The big problem is that this is
the morality of our own people

00:26:27.968 --> 00:26:29.760
make some improvements

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:37.184
The waste disposal law If you are punished by the
waste disposal law, these are criminal penalties

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.584
Administrative law is fortunate, administrative
law is not known to everyone, it is just fines

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.984
If it involves the criminal law, it is really serious.
What does it mean to involve the criminal law?

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:56.384
That is, if your garbage affects people and
kills people, you will be sentenced to that

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.432
Life imprisonment or more than seven years

00:26:58.944 --> 00:27:05.088
30 million or less in prison

00:27:05.344 --> 00:27:11.488
More than three years but less than ten years,
more than 20,250,000, these words use influence

00:27:11.744 --> 00:27:17.888
If it goes to the human body or the environment, it is almost
always a fine to be arrested, not to say that the manufacturer

00:27:18.144 --> 00:27:24.344
People from public institutions should also be arrested and detained unless
your institution is powerful enough to have a relationship with the government.

00:27:24.544 --> 00:27:29.664
You don't have to shut it down,
anyway, there is a situation

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:36.064
For example, there is an
event of XX light like this

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.464
If you have anything better with the government,
then you won't put people in private.

00:27:43.232 --> 00:27:49.376
If you want to dispose of your rubbish, you need
to store it properly and as mentioned earlier.

00:27:49.632 --> 00:27:53.472
These are some regulations to be done well

00:27:58.848 --> 00:28:04.992
Let's take a look at some garbage in
Kaohsiung that is currently in Taiwan.

00:28:05.248 --> 00:28:11.392
The scavenger manufacturer and some unscrupulous operators dispose
of it indiscriminately, mainly at the bridgehead of Fengshan.

00:28:11.648 --> 00:28:17.792
And that Renwu Gangshan,
there are mostly Qishan

00:28:19.584 --> 00:28:21.120
watch the video

00:30:12.736 --> 00:30:18.880
I will talk about how the Environmental Protection Agency
conducts statistics, and if the garbage is to be sent out

00:30:19.136 --> 00:30:24.000
Go to the Internet to
declare for each business unit

00:31:34.144 --> 00:31:40.288
Destruction of the environment is even more abhorrent.
Starting this March, there are seven in Kaohsiung

00:31:40.544 --> 00:31:46.920
The vacant land of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Bureau has been
dumped by the tenant, and the cleaning fee for waste disposal is as high as 1.1 billion yuan

00:31:46.944 --> 00:31:53.088
I am afraid that the whole
people have to pay the bill again.

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:59.488
There are 2,000,000 tons of general industrial waste sent to landfills
in Taiwan every year, but there are only two private enterprises

00:31:59.744 --> 00:32:05.888
The capacity of the operating landfill is less than one
million tons, and these wastes have nowhere to be buried.

00:32:06.144 --> 00:32:12.288
Now, the hillside where we stand under our feet is made
up of 2,000 tons of rubbish. You can see this hillside.

00:32:12.544 --> 00:32:18.688
There are gravel, wires, glass, and tiles
inside, and it has not been cleaned up until now.

00:32:18.944 --> 00:32:21.175
There's grass growing on it, let him stink

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.319
In May last year, residents of this hillside
in Qishan protested against smoldering garbage

00:32:25.344 --> 00:32:31.720
The suspect rented state-owned land but littered the Kaohsiung Environmental Protection Bureau. Statistics
from the Kaohsiung Environmental Protection Bureau have 7 state-owned property offices since 2013.

00:32:31.744 --> 00:32:37.888
The waste was maliciously discarded by the industry, but the landowner's
office did not deal with it. Today, the cost is 1.1 billion yuan.

00:32:38.144 --> 00:32:43.600
Finally, at the end of July this year, in order to avoid breeding vector mosquitoes,
the Environmental Protection Bureau first began to clear and transport them on behalf of

00:32:43.624 --> 00:32:50.688
It took 20 days to clear the 400 tons of waste plastic mixture at
the junction of Daliao and Fengshan, and it cost 1,900,000 yuan.

00:32:50.944 --> 00:32:53.910
Environmentally friendly
cockroaches are everywhere

00:32:53.935 --> 00:32:58.218
Good factory but encounter
environmental protection cockroach rental

00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:04.851
Qiaotou District Prosecutor's Office seized 12 cases of 4,266
metric tons of garbage in March, costing 30 to 68 million yuan

00:33:05.447 --> 00:33:10.767
Why did Taiwan become an abandoned paradise?
25 abandoned cases were found in 2016

00:33:10.792 --> 00:33:16.288
100 metric tons were stolen near Taichung high-speed rail,
forming a 120-meter-long 14-meter-high garbage mountain

00:33:16.544 --> 00:33:23.448
According to the statistics of the Environmental Protection Agency of
the year, it needs to send 2.1 million tons of waste to the landfill.

00:33:23.473 --> 00:33:29.088
2.56 million tons, but there are only two private
burial capacity left in the country, 410,000 tons.

00:33:29.344 --> 00:33:35.488
Forty thousand waste management businesses store
710,000 tons of sludge and 190,000 tons of slag

00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:52.232
Forty thousand waste management businesses store
710,000 tons of sludge and 190,000 tons of slag

00:33:52.257 --> 00:33:56.014
However, the cases of illegal industrial
waste disposal are increasing year by year

00:33:56.039 --> 00:34:01.088
106 years of illegal disposal
of industrial waste nationwide

00:34:01.113 --> 00:34:05.189
A total of 26 cases were transferred
for investigation and handling

00:34:05.523 --> 00:34:08.925
A total of 19.37 million metric
tons of industrial waste was declared

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:14.119
There are some business operators
who are greedy for this and this benefit.

00:34:14.144 --> 00:34:17.896
He couldn't have sent this to a disposal
plant and then disposed of it illegally

00:34:17.935 --> 00:34:21.202
If you want to set up a new landfill, there
will be strong resistance from local residents

00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:27.266
In 2016, the waste disposal law was revised, and the fines
soared from below 15 million yuan to below 30 million yuan

00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:30.109
High fines seem to be unable to stop
environmental cockroaches rampant

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:35.593
In the end, the problem lies in the lack of landfills. How
to review it has also become a hot potato for the government

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.984
He just talked about the problem
with that landfill, if the landfill

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.384
Taiwan is running out of places to store it.
If you are looking for a place to bury it,

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:03.016
It's very troublesome because you have to go through some processes of environmental
impact assessment by some government units before you can be willing to do it

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:10.641
These garbage are buried for hundreds of years and tens of thousands
of years, so he can let you do the burial after these assessments.

00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:15.584
As for the landfill, if you find
some land, there are some places

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.704
How big is the land to be assessed

00:35:21.216 --> 00:35:23.264
Then again that

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.664
For example, our company NXP's sludge
removal is currently looking for that

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:36.064
But Lin Wei, he is now because the landfill is
getting less and less and the price has been rising

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:43.506
Many, many manufacturers are
just messing around for this landfill.

00:35:43.572 --> 00:35:48.864
He won't be willing to spend so much money to deal with
this garbage. In fact, the future problems will be endless.

00:35:49.888 --> 00:35:56.032
There will always be problems, but in the future I don't know
how to solve it anyway, how will this government solve it

00:35:58.592 --> 00:36:03.901
Does everyone know the
CPP? McDonald's, or is it?

00:36:03.926 --> 00:36:09.600
Major manufacturers use
this chicken nugget or chicken

00:36:09.856 --> 00:36:16.000
This is their biggest thing, why did the boss come out and
apologize because the sludge was disposed of indiscriminately

00:36:16.256 --> 00:36:22.400
That in Changhua is for manufacturers
and manufacturers to save this money

00:36:22.656 --> 00:36:28.800
In order to save this money, they directly cleared
the manufacturer and cleared it out without arriving.

00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:35.200
The sludge treated by the treatment plant is divided into some harmful
sludge and biological sludge, which are the most difficult to treat.

00:36:35.456 --> 00:36:40.870
Harmful sludge is quite simple,
just find a place to bury it and that's it

00:36:41.137 --> 00:36:48.000
For biological sludge, you have to spend more
money on equipment to remove these sludges.

00:36:48.256 --> 00:36:54.400
But he just poured the money directly into
the farmland in Changhua to save the money.

00:36:54.656 --> 00:37:00.800
Why was it discovered that
there were some farmers nearby

00:37:01.056 --> 00:37:05.345
pile of dirty things

00:37:05.412 --> 00:37:11.808
The EPA went to the source to find out
that they were trying to avoid the money

00:37:12.064 --> 00:37:18.208
To avoid this processing fee and then just
dispose of it indiscriminately to save these costs

00:37:18.464 --> 00:37:20.000
to the whole

00:37:20.256 --> 00:37:24.864
Everyone in Taiwan will affect
that social corporate responsibility

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.544
He talked about something he skipped the reuse
process and went straight to the business unit

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.944
After clearing the manufacturer to save the money,
it is directly poured over to the extension here.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.832
Some of the resulting problems
are bigger and that still can't be solved

00:37:45.088 --> 00:37:51.463
water pollution law

00:37:51.488 --> 00:37:57.632
In the case of water pollution law, if the company
wants to expand a factory or build a factory

00:37:57.888 --> 00:38:04.032
Will receive some waste water from the site, and if the waste
water comes down, there are some heavy metals in the waste water.

00:38:04.288 --> 00:38:10.432
Toxic substances, you have to go through these and need to be
treated before they can be discharged. Then you need to set

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:16.832
In the case of a wastewater facility, you need to know these
pollutants and whether your facility has enough people to operate it

00:38:17.088 --> 00:38:23.232
Then, if it is ok, it is necessary to make regular declarations,
including setting up special personnel and water quality.

00:38:23.488 --> 00:38:29.632
After the automatic monitoring facility is
discharged, some regulatory standards must be met

00:38:29.888 --> 00:38:35.264
Even if it meets the regulatory standards, he has to
pay some water pollution prevention and control fees.

00:38:35.776 --> 00:38:41.920
As for the wastewater plant, if you do
the discharge again, you are prohibited.

00:38:42.176 --> 00:38:48.320
No bypass discharge, no illegal
dilution, just use tap water to make sewage

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:52.900
It is impossible to reduce the concentration
of pollutants inside after dilution.

00:38:52.925 --> 00:38:54.805
Including injection into
groundwater bodies and

00:38:54.976 --> 00:39:00.608
The control area does not have
this item in Nanzi Processing Park

00:39:07.264 --> 00:39:13.408
And then talk to him is to tell him that
before you set up you need to have one

00:39:13.664 --> 00:39:19.808
You need to submit the water measures plan to the management
office and the Environmental Protection Bureau for review.

00:39:20.064 --> 00:39:26.208
Only when the submission is completed can there be some
approval documents for water measures and discharge permits

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:32.608
Only after these can we set up special personnel, and then we
can do the operation and the process of doing the operation.

00:39:32.864 --> 00:39:39.008
In the production process of the factory,
these are all actions that need to be declared.

00:39:40.288 --> 00:39:46.432
The Water Pollution Law cannot. If there are
some problems, there will be some regulations.

00:39:46.688 --> 00:39:52.832
For example, it is not normal operation such as not
exceeding the standard, stealing, diluting, etc.

00:39:53.088 --> 00:39:59.232
It is impossible to draw 20000000 at
the highest level without normal operation

00:39:59.488 --> 00:40:05.632
Because he will also extend to some waste, because
waste water is also equal to waste, he will also

00:40:05.888 --> 00:40:09.728
If you break the law, he will

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:16.384
Add some rubbish laws to add not only 20000000
for example there is a company near us

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.784
He was already sentenced
by the Supreme Court in 2020

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:29.859
20000000, but in 2020, it will become 40000000 after
checking it again. Why because he added the waste item

00:40:30.192 --> 00:40:35.584
If you are like that over the limit

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.984
There are also some administrative sanctions and some
criminal laws. Administrative sanctions are just fines.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.588
If the criminal law is just
about to arrest the waste

00:40:45.613 --> 00:40:48.615
What does it mean to arrest and
detain a person from a business unit?

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:56.044
Or the people you discharge are all going to be arrested and detained.
The biggest plot is so serious that it makes work or business stop.

00:40:56.094 --> 00:41:02.238
Closed until when will
it open until you improve

00:41:02.464 --> 00:41:07.328
Here are some sketches of the
company's water distribution plant

00:41:07.584 --> 00:41:13.728
Then what I just said is that this is
the information of the current company

00:41:13.984 --> 00:41:20.128
At that time, the data about some pollution sources that the management
office and the Environmental Protection Bureau applied for were:

00:41:20.384 --> 00:41:26.528
The following diagrams include PH COD and
lead, total chromium, copper, zinc, and nickel.

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:32.928
These will be discharged after
being treated in our wastewater plant.

00:41:33.184 --> 00:41:37.024
Comply with the regulatory standards
of the park where the discharge is made

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.632
The groundwater that can be discharged to
the underground water pipe management office

00:41:42.656 --> 00:41:48.800
Then this is from xx company and then

00:41:49.056 --> 00:41:55.199
If you compare this room, you should know that
everyone lives nearby. In fact, he discharges

00:41:55.455 --> 00:42:01.599
The stagnant stream is actually
quite serious, he flowed to that oyster li

00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:07.999
Well, this stream, it undertakes CNPC and

00:42:08.024 --> 00:42:14.861
In the processing area, there is also some waste water in the Dashe Industrial
Zone and Renwu Industrial Zone. If your waste water has not been treated properly

00:42:14.886 --> 00:42:18.726
It is directly discharged here, the
whole is polluted to the whole river

00:42:18.751 --> 00:42:24.895
In fact, their requirement is that what they
just said is that the standard discharge is

00:42:25.151 --> 00:42:32.158
It's ok, but if you don't deal with it well, just let
it out. This is the picture of Zeppelin seeing Taiwan.

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:37.695
There's a problem with the whole thing. Actually,
the stagnant stream looks pretty clean now.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:45.384
In fact, it is still being rectified. Some
pollutants that cannot be seen are left in the soil.

00:42:45.409 --> 00:42:47.423
There are rivers and life

00:42:47.679 --> 00:42:53.823
Well, I have to wait for that. I have read the literature before,
that is, the teacher should see what they are still doing.

00:42:54.079 --> 00:43:00.223
The rectification information means that in fact, it
takes a hundred recitations to complete the rectification.

00:43:00.479 --> 00:43:05.855
It's okay, don't go fishing
there and watch the video

00:43:26.033 --> 00:43:27.903
Because he is a pipeline for the whole sea

00:43:27.928 --> 00:43:28.980
It's all long pipes

00:43:29.366 --> 00:43:30.832
Come this way, all the way here

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.198
Finally out to sea

00:43:32.404 --> 00:43:33.840
This is the last exit to the sea.

00:43:33.865 --> 00:43:35.338
This is the last vent

00:43:35.475 --> 00:43:38.599
It's so damn good. Prosecutors are
investigating ASE's case of stealing wastewater

00:43:38.623 --> 00:43:42.823
It was found that the K7 field secretly buried the
underground pipe and directly discharged sewage into the sea

00:43:42.847 --> 00:43:50.329
The prosecutor went to the k7 factory at night to confirm the location of the hidden pipe and collected
the sediment and water from all over the place, and rushed back to the local prosecutor's office for court

00:43:50.353 --> 00:43:57.268
Including Su Bingshuo, director of the K7 factory, Cai Qixun, director of the waste
water group, and Yan Junming, manager of the wind business department, were interviewed

00:43:57.293 --> 00:44:03.967
In addition, the eight K7 factory employees summoned on the evening of the 12th
leaked the night investigation and three wastewater discharge operators after 8 hours

00:44:03.992 --> 00:44:11.298
They also paid 500,000 to 700,000 yuan on bail. The prosecution also made compulsory
punishment for the first time and changed the case to a case investigation.

00:44:11.323 --> 00:44:18.443
In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has also ordered the inspection team in the morning
to comprehensively check whether other factories of ASE also have illegal discharge of waste water.

00:44:18.467 --> 00:44:23.167
Once seized, it will suspend work and recover the illegal
income in accordance with the practice of Kaohsiung City

00:44:38.783 --> 00:44:44.927
ASE steals waste water from the water surface
under the Demin Bridge in Houjinxi, Kaohsiung

00:44:45.183 --> 00:44:51.327
Floating down stream water polluted with carcinogenic toxic
heavy metals with a large amount of white chemical foam

00:44:51.583 --> 00:44:57.959
The 940 hectares of farmland downstream may also suffer. The Environmental Protection
Bureau of Gao City will trace the source of pollution in October this year.

00:44:57.983 --> 00:45:04.127
It was found that the waste water was actually discharged by the world's
largest semiconductor packaging and testing factory, the ASE K7 factory

00:45:04.485 --> 00:45:10.313
Chen Jinde, Director of Environmental Protection of Kaohsiung
City, personally led a team to inspect the ASE factory yesterday.

00:45:10.338 --> 00:45:16.826
It's really vicious and serious

00:45:16.873 --> 00:45:19.191
We last year because we
considered that ASE is a big factory

00:45:19.215 --> 00:45:21.134
Give him a chance to improve

00:45:21.159 --> 00:45:23.784
I didn't expect it to be
October 1st this year

00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:26.859
This is my EPA guy at Demin Bridge

00:45:26.884 --> 00:45:29.006
Found someone stealing waste water

00:45:29.031 --> 00:45:31.570
Then trace the source
to trace the moonlight

00:45:31.623 --> 00:45:36.358
ASE announced only yesterday that the
group's revenue in November was 21.97 billion

00:45:36.383 --> 00:45:42.527
In terms of revenue of 220 billion this year, I did not expect
such a large-scale enterprise to illegally discharge wastewater

00:45:42.783 --> 00:45:48.298
Poisoned Kaohsiung City Councillors, Taiwan

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:55.327
Leaving the pollution of the environment to Kaohsiung
people is really a sweatshop for the rich and unkind.

00:45:55.583 --> 00:46:01.305
Has been found to discharge wastewater and
fined many times ASE, so in June last year

00:46:01.498 --> 00:46:08.101
Installed water quality monitoring equipment but still found that the
drainage did not meet the standard and fined 600,000 in October this year

00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:15.597
The inspectors also found that the water tank that ASE provided the Environmental
Protection Bureau to sample was filled with wastewater diluted with tap water.

00:46:15.622 --> 00:46:22.041
The strong acid wastewater discharged into Houjin Stream is completely
untreated strong acid wastewater. Lin Xiantang, deputy general manager of ASE

00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:28.096
Yesterday, I was preparing materials to explain to the media,
but I was refuted by Chen Jinde before I finished speaking.

00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:32.918
The violations are serious and
the sophistry is still arguing until now

00:46:32.943 --> 00:46:40.127
did not acknowledge the fact that they
deliberately avoided such a fact, so we will

00:46:40.383 --> 00:46:44.534
Sewage law imposes heavy fines,
otherwise it will order suspension of work

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:47.432
EPA will fine ASE 600,000

00:46:47.485 --> 00:46:52.927
If no valid reason can be presented within 10 days, the K7 factory
will be ordered to suspend the production of Kaohsiung farmland water

00:46:53.246 --> 00:46:59.390
The Water Conservancy Association said that the stinky water of Houjin
Stream is the worst farmer in Kaohsiung City's irrigation water.

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:05.865
When farmers hear about ASE's waste water, it's
terrible, and big tech companies only make money

00:47:05.983 --> 00:47:11.738
Kaohsiung City Government has invested 3.7 billion in 6 years
to remediate the Jinxi River before it has achieved some results

00:47:11.765 --> 00:47:18.527
And it was destroyed by ASE who secretly drained nickel-containing wastewater.
Once the doctor said that nickel is recognized by the World Health Organization

00:47:18.783 --> 00:47:22.277
Carcinogen may cause
lung cancer, prostate cancer

00:47:22.314 --> 00:47:27.003
In the past, the experience of farmland being polluted by
heavy metals such as cadmium required a century of fallow

00:47:27.028 --> 00:47:31.327
Only heavy metals in the land can
fully decompose ASE denied yesterday

00:47:31.583 --> 00:47:37.727
Using tap water as a fake for sampling and saying
that this is an unusual and unexpected security

00:47:37.983 --> 00:47:45.327
Experts say the shutdown of ASE K7 factory will affect the
global supply chain of smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.

00:48:04.095 --> 00:48:10.239
He just talked about this thing

00:48:10.495 --> 00:48:15.103
That problem is a bit like
our park, his wastewater plant

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:22.016
As long as the discharged wastewater will be collected at the oxygen water
station of the water raising station management office for collection

00:48:22.314 --> 00:48:28.134
The first level will be controlled there.
Why does this happen is because of this

00:48:28.159 --> 00:48:34.303
The company has applied to Kaohsiung City for a direct
discharge to the surface water body, so there is this pipeline.

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:40.877
In this pipeline, in fact, he has another one, that is, he did
not apply directly. This incident is the one who did not apply.

00:48:40.959 --> 00:48:45.823
I can't get it at the pipeline
management office I applied for.

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:52.223
Why do you bring this incident out? Because this incident
is in Kaohsiung and everyone in Taiwan knows it because

00:48:52.479 --> 00:48:56.319
All I have now learned about
the largest wastewater plant

00:48:56.575 --> 00:49:02.719
If there is a problem with the wastewater,
there will be an abnormality and will be fined.

00:49:02.975 --> 00:49:09.119
This is the 47 million fined by Kaohsiung City and
told him why the highest 20 million went to 47 million

00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:14.593
Just because it's covering some of the
waste that's because of that nickel row

00:49:14.647 --> 00:49:18.153
Nickel is also considered
a heavy metal in that waste.
