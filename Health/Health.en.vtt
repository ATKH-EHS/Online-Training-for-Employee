WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.533
Everyone must have heard
of high blood pressure, right?

00:00:04.013 --> 00:00:05.480
Raise your hand

00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:11.264
There must be a thick
myocardial infarction.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.408
Yes, have you heard of CPR and AED?

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.255
both

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:38.889
I just had some small problems, sorry

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:42.647
Then wait, I hope
there will be some

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.616
interaction, I hope you
can give me some Feedback

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:51.200
I'll say it's important, it's important

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:54.861
This is very important, wait for
the test and you will pass the test.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:59.401
There will be 3 questions in
my part, you should remember

00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:04.435
Everyone knows high
blood pressure, so do

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:07.328
you know how our blood
pressure is measured?

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.436
How is blood pressure measured

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:15.976
sphygmomanometer

00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:19.268
How does the blood
pressure monitor measure?

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:26.602
I don't know, I will broadcast a
short video later, you can watch it

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.305
How is blood pressure measured

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:51.494
Did we just see a heart beating there

00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:54.688
Well, our heart is like a pump

00:01:55.006 --> 00:02:03.325
He'll help us pump the blood
that goes back to the heart like this

00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:06.640
Blood pressure is the
pressure in the blood

00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:09.792
its pressure in the
walls of the blood vessels

00:02:10.048 --> 00:02:13.376
It's called our blood pressure

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.124
Let's wait a minute.
The first blood pressure

00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:23.104
measured is called
systolic blood pressure.

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.485
Now this is the systolic
blood pressure, and

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:33.344
later we will see our
diastolic blood pressure

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:44.775
Okay, so everyone should know
how to measure blood pressure.

00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:48.192
Then let's take a look

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.616
Do you know what our
normal blood pressure is?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.675
Our normal blood
pressure is 80 low from 120

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.600
this is very important

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:09.184
Very important

00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:15.767
Ordinary people may think
that if my blood pressure

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.742
is greater than 120 and
less than 130, it is not OK

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.128
Yes, but the problem is that
this is the pre-hypertension

00:03:28.384 --> 00:03:33.504
What maintenance we can
usually do I'll tell you later

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.729
Then if your blood pressure
is already high enough

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:40.160
to what he calls a high
blood pressure crisis

00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:42.782
What should you do if your
systolic blood pressure is greater

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:45.024
than 180 and your diastolic
blood pressure is greater than 120

00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:48.818
What are your symptoms if
your blood pressure is too high?

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.848
Some people may experience headaches

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:00.731
right

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.799
Some people with high blood
pressure should have headaches,

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.328
or if the blood pressure is too
high, they may have dizziness.

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:11.392
Then I want to ask

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.744
How often do you have your
blood pressure measured?

00:04:28.724 --> 00:04:32.497
We ordinary people will
feel that there is no physical

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.157
discomfort. Why do we need
to measure blood pressure?

00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.660
In fact, the government's
recommendation is to

00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:44.275
say that our average
blood pressure is normal.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.055
In fact, normal people
need to measure their

00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:51.583
blood pressure every
six months to a year.

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.631
Every six months to one year

00:04:53.887 --> 00:04:59.453
Well that means if your family
has no history of genetic diseases

00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:02.991
Then I measure my blood
pressure and it's pretty normal.

00:05:03.297 --> 00:05:06.663
It doesn't matter if you measure your
blood pressure during the health check

00:05:06.943 --> 00:05:09.759
But the question is if

00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:12.575
you have diabetes today

00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:14.111
kidney disease

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:16.159
So how often do we measure

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:27.423
The government's recommendation
is that twice a month is enough.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:34.240
If you usually measure blood pressure
and do not have high blood pressure

00:05:34.264 --> 00:05:37.894
Monitor your blood pressure every month

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.015
But if so today you are a
patient with high blood pressure

00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:45.343
Blood pressure is too high

00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:46.951
what to do

00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:49.183
how often do we measure

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:58.143
Tomorrow is morning and night

00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.471
Measure blood pressure
during these two periods

00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.358
Why choose morning and night?

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:09.919
In the morning, just woke
up, blood pressure fluctuated

00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:12.735
The float comparison won't be so big

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:19.391
Do we also sort out our emotions
before going to bed at night?

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.266
At that time, our blood pressure
measurement fluctuations were not so large.

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:27.327
Blood pressure will be more accurate

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.263
How often do you think
80-year-olds should be measured?

00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:38.335
if he said

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:40.639
No history of hypertension

00:06:40.895 --> 00:06:44.052
It is normal to measure
blood pressure normally,

00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:47.039
and it is recommended
to measure once a month.

00:06:47.796 --> 00:06:53.951
But if you find that his blood pressure is
measured, it seems to fluctuate every time

00:06:54.463 --> 00:06:59.327
If it is not so stable, I will
measure the movement every day

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:05.983
Have you noticed the
elderly over the age of 80?

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:11.615
Why is his systolic blood
pressure lower than 150?

00:07:12.358 --> 00:07:13.691
Have you ever thought about

00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:22.173
Because the elasticity of the blood
vessels in the elderly is relatively poor

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:25.293
So the doctor would
suggest that it doesn't

00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:28.511
matter if your blood
pressure is lower than 150.

00:07:32.762 --> 00:07:35.928
There are two types of high blood pressure

00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:38.751
The first is primary

00:07:39.344 --> 00:07:45.663
If it is primary, it may be
because of the family history.

00:07:46.687 --> 00:07:49.247
Or older

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:52.319
Or you are smoking

00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:54.111
or it could be

00:07:55.903 --> 00:08:00.255
I believe the person with high
blood pressure is in the workplace

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.386
The blood pressure
measurement data will be more than

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:06.911
Blood pressure usually
measured at home is still high

00:08:07.743 --> 00:08:08.543
right

00:08:09.827 --> 00:08:12.060
don't know it's okay

00:08:12.104 --> 00:08:15.404
Next time if you say take
your blood pressure at home

00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:17.407
you can remember your numbers

00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:23.443
And then when I say that after the
meeting with the boss, I get emotional

00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:25.166
Then stress

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.971
I'm sure your blood
pressure will be higher then

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.511
You can try it next time

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:37.578
After talking about primary,
there is another called secondary

00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:43.263
It may be caused by factors of your disease

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:44.799
for example

00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:47.359
diabetes thyroid

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:52.735
There are some chronic diseases that can
affect the function of our blood vessels

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:58.598
The condition that indirectly
affects our blood pressure

00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:01.951
So let's hear what the doctor has to say

00:10:00.575 --> 00:10:02.623
I want to ask everyone

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:06.719
red neck is high blood pressure

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.980
Not necessarily, so how do you know

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:17.215
Your neck is red, will you
take your blood pressure?

00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:19.263
Won't

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:24.639
Okay, let's see what the doctor has to say

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:37.552
The doctor just
said that high blood

00:11:37.564 --> 00:11:40.927
pressure can cause
damage to many body organs

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:43.235
Do you know what the damage is?

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:55.519
High blood pressure can
affect many organs if say

00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:59.359
High blood pressure affects our brain

00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:01.618
what will happen

00:12:06.015 --> 00:12:07.551
stroke

00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:08.831
have points

00:12:16.255 --> 00:12:22.399
Our strokes are divided into
hemorrhagic and obstructive strokes

00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:26.751
What are the symptoms of
stroke, big brother, can you share?

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.838
Everyone should have seen a stroke

00:12:52.863 --> 00:12:58.524
Some mild strokes and some serious strokes

00:12:58.549 --> 00:13:01.544
some mild stroke he may

00:13:01.568 --> 00:13:09.998
After training, he may still be
able to walk like a normal person

00:13:10.032 --> 00:13:15.182
But you can see that his gait
will be less like us normal people.

00:13:15.207 --> 00:13:20.006
It will feel a little
biased, if it is serious

00:13:20.031 --> 00:13:23.360
Maybe it's all in the hospital bed

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:25.631
The part that needs help

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:32.031
If this high blood
pressure affects our eyes

00:13:32.757 --> 00:13:35.257
What do you think about our eyes?

00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:41.613
If high blood pressure affects our eyes

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.799
Our eyes have many tiny blood vessels

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:49.183
Pressure vessels burst

00:13:50.207 --> 00:13:54.559
May cause temporary blindness

00:13:55.842 --> 00:13:59.909
Do you feel scared if you can't see it?

00:14:00.703 --> 00:14:04.031
It should be more frightening than
the feeling of not being able to hear it.

00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:08.313
Yes, so we need to take
good care of our eyes

00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:13.503
What if high blood pressure
affects our blood vessels?

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:15.295
what might we be

00:14:17.855 --> 00:14:20.671
may affect our aorta

00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:22.207
there may be

00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:27.839
A tumor or aortic valve
dissection may be the case here

00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:30.143
if blood pressure

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:32.191
it affects our kidneys

00:14:32.665 --> 00:14:34.164
what if it's serious

00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:38.442
In severe cases, kidney dialysis may be

00:14:38.892 --> 00:14:44.795
You see this high blood pressure
is really bad, he's a badass

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.560
What if he affects our hearts?

00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:53.439
myocardial infarction angina pectoris

00:14:54.207 --> 00:14:57.470
That's the scariest thing

00:14:57.495 --> 00:15:02.154
Yesterday or the day before yesterday,
everyone should have seen the news, right?

00:15:02.655 --> 00:15:04.191
The one in Pingtung

00:15:05.727 --> 00:15:08.499
Okay, I'll play the video later

00:15:08.523 --> 00:15:12.110
In fact, these are the
symptoms of high blood pressure

00:15:12.243 --> 00:15:16.652
Do you have any tinnitus,
numbness in hands and feet,

00:15:16.664 --> 00:15:20.593
heart palpitations, can't
eat and want to vomit?

00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:22.353
I think should not be

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.486
Everyone is in good shape

00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:32.863
What if our high blood pressure

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:34.399
usually

00:15:34.878 --> 00:15:38.116
If you have high blood
pressure, you have seen a doctor

00:15:38.128 --> 00:15:41.261
and the doctor has prescribed
medicine for you to eat.

00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:44.127
Most likely these drugs

00:15:44.895 --> 00:15:47.711
The first is a calcium blocker

00:15:48.297 --> 00:15:49.919
What about his words?

00:15:49.943 --> 00:15:52.850
Everyone should be taking
antihypertensive drugs

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:56.130
Or his family members are
taking antihypertensive drugs

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:59.206
The most common is
probably this one called Norvasc

00:15:59.231 --> 00:16:02.303
Its side effects may be noticed

00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:07.423
Be careful when you eat

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:09.498
Our Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon

00:16:09.522 --> 00:16:12.031
we will eat grapefruit

00:16:12.287 --> 00:16:17.384
Whether it's a pomelo or a
grapefruit, it has flavonoids in it.

00:16:17.484 --> 00:16:20.479
It affects the metabolism of our liver

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:27.256
He wants a drug, almost all of our drugs
are metabolized in the liver, you know?

00:16:29.127 --> 00:16:32.879
Then if we eat something
containing flavonoids

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:36.095
that affects the
metabolism of our liver

00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:39.423
So these drugs like this Norvasc

00:16:39.935 --> 00:16:41.215
he will

00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.864
The effect of this
medicine will be in our body

00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:46.261
continued

00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:48.837
But we take this medicine every day

00:16:48.862 --> 00:16:51.401
That medicine has been in our body forever

00:16:51.763 --> 00:16:56.575
It may cause our body to
have low blood pressure

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.040
Low blood pressure can make us dizzy

00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:03.271
You may faint in the end

00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:06.392
Or the whole body is uncomfortable

00:17:07.798 --> 00:17:09.115
The second one

00:17:09.631 --> 00:17:11.679
Inhibit vasoconstriction

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.800
Here he wrote

00:17:13.983 --> 00:17:20.127
He wrote here that we should be cautious
about eating potassium-containing diets

00:17:20.895 --> 00:17:26.783
Anyone know why he's advising us
to be careful about potassium salts?

00:17:27.295 --> 00:17:30.111
because of these drugs

00:17:30.313 --> 00:17:32.180
this drug

00:17:32.415 --> 00:17:37.535
His side effects can
make our blood oxygen rise

00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:40.095
what we usually eat

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:46.511
Do you know what foods contain potassium?

00:17:48.474 --> 00:17:49.574
What?

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.383
banana

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:55.711
kiwi

00:17:56.223 --> 00:17:58.527
So take these medicines

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:03.135
You may need to pay attention to your diet

00:18:03.903 --> 00:18:06.207
There's also a diuretic

00:18:08.106 --> 00:18:11.327
Usually the most common is Spiratone

00:18:12.095 --> 00:18:15.935
Diuretics are known as diuretics

00:18:16.447 --> 00:18:20.287
Diuresis is to help us urinate

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:25.407
Let our body excrete more water

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:30.352
If so, would we suggest that
he take this medicine at night?

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:35.989
Because we probably don't want to get up
at night to go to the toilet all the time.

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:41.535
Therefore, doctors recommend
taking this medicine during the day.

00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.607
This will not affect your sleep at night

00:18:46.064 --> 00:18:50.395
The last one is the alpha blocker

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:56.383
He actually acts on our
blood vessels to dilate

00:18:56.639 --> 00:19:02.783
So if you dilate this blood vessel,
when we change positions quickly

00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:05.950
makes us feel dizzy

00:19:06.008 --> 00:19:09.187
This is called postural hypotension

00:19:09.242 --> 00:19:13.570
So sometimes we have to pay
attention when taking this drug again.

00:19:13.595 --> 00:19:20.636
We can't get up after a quick squat

00:19:20.661 --> 00:19:22.690
Because our blood may have no way

00:19:22.715 --> 00:19:24.890
So fast flow to our brain

00:19:24.937 --> 00:19:29.993
This makes it easy for us to fall

00:19:30.577 --> 00:19:32.991
everyone will want to say

00:19:33.247 --> 00:19:36.317
Do I have to take medicine
for high blood pressure?

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:41.851
If you say he thinks
you don't need medicine

00:19:41.951 --> 00:19:44.255
Maybe it's just maintenance

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:49.747
Also, make adjustments to your usual diet

00:19:50.285 --> 00:19:51.552
words here

00:19:51.645 --> 00:19:54.239
I have written about the comfort food

00:19:55.263 --> 00:19:57.055
we can eat

00:19:57.311 --> 00:20:02.431
Whole-grain rhizomes So
what is whole-grain rhizomes?

00:20:04.988 --> 00:20:09.288
What are whole grain rhizomes

00:20:15.743 --> 00:20:18.303
root food

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:25.727
radishes don't count

00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:29.311
Sweet potato taro?

00:20:32.895 --> 00:20:34.175
that vegetable

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:41.864
Today's lunch box contains

00:20:46.207 --> 00:20:49.279
Who has lunch from the company today?

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.115
what's the dish today

00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:58.495
Is this a vegetable?

00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:01.456
Everyone should know that meat

00:21:02.335 --> 00:21:04.127
what is white meat

00:21:05.663 --> 00:21:09.747
Chicken and fish, right?

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:12.831
He also wrote here

00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:17.952
If you want two glasses of
low-fat milk a day, please ask

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.768
1 cup low-fat milk

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:24.096
Do you know how much CC is?

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.192
It's from the government

00:21:29.216 --> 00:21:33.312
One cup is equal to 240cc,
how much are two cups equal to?

00:21:34.848 --> 00:21:36.384
480 is fine

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.992
It is written here that try
to eat nuts and use good oil

00:21:41.248 --> 00:21:42.528
Excuse me

00:21:42.784 --> 00:21:43.808
nuts

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:46.403
daily intake

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.416
should be a few grams

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.232
let me take a look

00:21:52.768 --> 00:21:56.096
third in the row

00:21:56.352 --> 00:22:00.192
Brother, how many nuts do
you think you eat in a day?

00:22:00.484 --> 00:22:02.384
A few grams would be better

00:22:02.752 --> 00:22:06.336
One of ours is about 10 grams

00:22:10.432 --> 00:22:16.576
If we eat more than that, it is
also accumulated in our body fat.

00:22:19.392 --> 00:22:21.184
come and see

00:22:21.829 --> 00:22:25.669
This is our daily health
care. Are you exercising?

00:22:27.257 --> 00:22:27.990
Have it?

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.890
raised hand

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.192
I still think that everyone

00:22:32.448 --> 00:22:35.520
We go home and work every day so tired

00:22:35.776 --> 00:22:38.848
How is it possible that there
is still time for sports activities?

00:22:39.662 --> 00:22:40.995
me too

00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:47.552
Ok, then I want to ask if
the government has pushed

00:22:48.064 --> 00:22:53.440
Do you know what the
333 movement principle is?

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.061
do you know

00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:02.094
don't know good

00:23:02.656 --> 00:23:07.264
333 Exercise Principles
Exercise 3 days a week

00:23:07.776 --> 00:23:11.104
Exercise 30 minutes a day

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.688
Then our heartbeat keeps

00:23:14.944 --> 00:23:18.016
Heart rate maintained
above 130 during exercise

00:23:18.528 --> 00:23:21.344
This is our 333 Movement Principle

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.928
Hope we can do it together

00:23:26.208 --> 00:23:30.199
It is not recommended
that the water temperature

00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:33.561
be too high or too
low when taking a bath

00:23:33.888 --> 00:23:35.680
do you know why

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.360
In fact, temperature is related to the
expansion and contraction of blood vessels.

00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:47.968
If your temperature is too
high our blood vessels dilate

00:23:48.224 --> 00:23:51.296
When the temperature is too
low, the blood vessels constrict

00:23:51.808 --> 00:23:59.651
So it happens when we're cold in a
state where we all shrank and shivered

00:23:59.718 --> 00:24:01.792
You can think about it

00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:04.442
Some people with high blood pressure

00:24:04.783 --> 00:24:06.950
He'll tell me when it's winter

00:24:07.351 --> 00:24:12.288
Why is my blood pressure
so high today to winter?

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:21.288
That's how our blood vessels constrict when
our blood is going out of our blood vessels

00:24:21.504 --> 00:24:23.808
increased blood pressure

00:24:24.576 --> 00:24:25.600
right

00:24:26.112 --> 00:24:30.464
Our blood vessels dilate when
the weather is hot in summer

00:24:30.617 --> 00:24:36.184
In our blood vessels, the pressure of
our blood flowing out will not be so great.

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:42.752
So in summer our blood pressure
will not be higher than in winter

00:24:44.288 --> 00:24:46.336
Is this clear to everyone?

00:24:46.848 --> 00:24:48.640
Ok good

00:24:48.896 --> 00:24:52.965
If you have high blood pressure,
you will be advised to quit

00:24:52.977 --> 00:24:57.393
smoking and drinking because
smoking is really bad for your health

00:24:58.624 --> 00:25:02.996
If you can quit smoking, quit smoking

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.608
Eat more fruits and vegetables
to prevent constipation

00:25:09.888 --> 00:25:12.960
If you need enough sleep, please ask

00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:17.824
How many hours do we sleep a day

00:25:19.616 --> 00:25:21.920
six to eight hours

00:25:22.432 --> 00:25:26.272
normal blood pressure

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.383
not written here

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:30.624
Eat a light diet

00:25:30.974 --> 00:25:32.641
Can you all cooperate?

00:25:33.184 --> 00:25:37.024
Light diet can not eat too salty too spicy

00:25:37.765 --> 00:25:41.932
It should be difficult or
everyone's usual diet is light

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.680
not so salty

00:25:44.078 --> 00:25:46.215
so good

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.056
There are parts that
protect your cardiovascular

00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:51.411
Then ask everyone

00:25:52.128 --> 00:25:56.992
Everyone's emotions are very calm when
they go to work, can they not be excited?

00:25:57.504 --> 00:25:59.040
it should be hard, right?

00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:03.879
But how can we make
our emotions more stable?

00:26:04.825 --> 00:26:07.792
What do you do when you're emotional

00:26:10.304 --> 00:26:11.328
silent

00:26:12.608 --> 00:26:13.632
listen to music

00:26:13.888 --> 00:26:14.912
pressure relief

00:26:17.728 --> 00:26:19.776
I want to ask again

00:26:20.032 --> 00:26:21.855
How to measure blood pressure

00:26:21.888 --> 00:26:25.722
Raise your hand if you have a
blood pressure monitor at home

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.784
Okay, so before you
take your blood pressure

00:26:31.296 --> 00:26:34.368
Will you take a 5-10 minute break first?

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.416
would be nice

00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:40.767
Do you take your blood
pressure immediately after

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:43.032
exercising before measuring
your blood pressure?

00:26:43.584 --> 00:26:48.369
Because the blood pressure
will be falsely high at that time

00:26:48.394 --> 00:26:51.071
If you want to measure
blood pressure, everyone

00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:53.884
will wear lighter clothes
to take the measurement.

00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:57.508
Before taking blood pressure

00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:59.179
we might be there

00:26:59.456 --> 00:27:02.149
Take a 3 to 5 minute break

00:27:02.174 --> 00:27:05.775
Let our whole mood be in a calm situation

00:27:06.112 --> 00:27:07.392
we'll start

00:27:07.904 --> 00:27:10.976
clothes like

00:27:11.488 --> 00:27:15.687
This eldest brother is fine,
because his clothes are thinner, so

00:27:15.699 --> 00:27:19.781
we don't need to roll up the
clothes when taking blood pressure

00:27:19.936 --> 00:27:26.080
But if the clothes are thicker in winter

00:27:26.105 --> 00:27:29.408
We may have to take
off our jackets a little bit.

00:27:29.711 --> 00:27:33.778
Then my blood pressure
readings will be more accurate.

00:27:34.272 --> 00:27:35.040
it is good

00:27:35.317 --> 00:27:36.384
Then come again

00:27:36.576 --> 00:27:40.928
Our feet must be flat on the ground

00:27:41.184 --> 00:27:44.512
Don't hang in the air or say tiptoe

00:27:45.024 --> 00:27:45.536
it is good

00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:52.080
Do you know how to place the
blood pressure monitor correctly?

00:27:53.728 --> 00:27:58.080
If our sphygmomanometer
says you are measuring

00:27:58.336 --> 00:28:00.384
the height of our hearts

00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:04.736
The height of our heart should be
parallel to the sphygmomanometer

00:28:05.068 --> 00:28:07.602
because you are too high or too low

00:28:07.674 --> 00:28:09.974
Blood pressure will be different

00:28:09.999 --> 00:28:14.595
It is possible that the blood
pressure you put this time will be lower.

00:28:14.653 --> 00:28:17.724
Or if you put a lower blood pressure,
the blood pressure will be higher.

00:28:17.749 --> 00:28:19.102
It's hard to say

00:28:19.584 --> 00:28:24.246
The above words are the part I
introduce about high blood pressure

00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:29.030
Next, I want to share the
video that I just told you.

00:29:00.827 --> 00:29:04.427
Would you be surprised
if you saw this scene?

00:29:05.696 --> 00:29:08.762
will it? what are you going to do?

00:29:10.016 --> 00:29:11.808
CPR AED right?

00:29:12.064 --> 00:29:18.065
In fact, our Taiwan
government has made statistics

00:29:18.753 --> 00:29:21.069
According to statistics
at the beginning of this

00:29:21.081 --> 00:29:23.361
year, our heart disease
is ranked in this year's

00:29:23.584 --> 00:29:26.400
Number two in the top ten causes of death

00:29:26.588 --> 00:29:32.800
In terms of myocardial infarction, it is
the number one priority of heart disease.

00:29:37.152 --> 00:29:39.456
Myocardial infarction

00:29:39.968 --> 00:29:44.576
How harmful it is to our body

00:29:45.952 --> 00:29:49.285
Have you ever wondered
what a myocardial infarction is?

00:29:51.232 --> 00:29:53.536
Okay, let's take a look at our right image

00:29:54.816 --> 00:30:00.448
The circle on the left is
our normal blood vessel

00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:10.854
Normal blood vessels should not have
bad things accumulated there, right?

00:30:11.712 --> 00:30:16.320
That second vein you can see
he's starting to have some bad stuff

00:30:16.568 --> 00:30:20.934
It may be the accumulation of
fat in the walls of our blood vessels

00:30:21.156 --> 00:30:23.244
Let's see the 4th

00:30:23.744 --> 00:30:27.462
In the fourth picture, do you see if
the space for him has become smaller?

00:30:27.487 --> 00:30:33.069
Then if our blood goes in from this place

00:30:33.094 --> 00:30:38.080
If he goes in like this from the fourth
circle, will he have greater resistance?

00:30:39.616 --> 00:30:41.920
It's possible this time

00:30:42.176 --> 00:30:45.248
He will have angina

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:50.311
So if he's all blocked,
it's a myocardial infarction

00:30:51.928 --> 00:30:56.161
Myocardial infarction within 4 minutes

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.540
There is use to AED

00:30:59.072 --> 00:31:01.120
His survival rate will be higher

00:31:01.632 --> 00:31:03.680
But if more than 4 minutes

00:31:04.192 --> 00:31:08.800
Every minute over we
increase our mortality rate by 1%

00:31:10.848 --> 00:31:14.432
So at the beginning of
a myocardial infarction

00:31:15.124 --> 00:31:18.058
I just didn't let everyone see the back

00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:23.392
One of the paramedics rushed right
up to help him with the CPR moves.

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:26.464
one thing is missing

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.000
AED

00:31:30.304 --> 00:31:33.632
Why does myocardial infarction occur?

00:31:34.656 --> 00:31:40.800
This yellow image is like the part of
the blood vessels I was talking about

00:31:41.568 --> 00:31:43.360
red is our blood vessels

00:31:43.872 --> 00:31:45.664
Yellow words are our fat

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.736
When more and more yellow places

00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:52.832
The permeability of our blood
vessels will get worse and worse

00:31:54.624 --> 00:31:57.440
That's how myocardial infarction happens

00:31:57.696 --> 00:32:03.840
The heart has large
triangular blood vessels

00:32:04.352 --> 00:32:05.888
right one

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.936
There are two on the left

00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:11.520
i want to ask

00:32:12.288 --> 00:32:16.384
Do you know the high-risk
groups for myocardial infarction?

00:32:19.369 --> 00:32:20.402
high blood pressure

00:32:20.736 --> 00:32:21.843
diabetes

00:32:21.867 --> 00:32:25.088
I just told you about the blood vessels

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.744
Too much fat may cause
his blood vessels to block

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:33.464
So he must also have hyperlipidemia

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.694
postmenopausal women

00:32:38.144 --> 00:32:39.872
In terms of high blood pressure

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:42.240
he has a heart attack

00:32:42.496 --> 00:32:47.104
He will be bigger than us

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.456
2.5 times more likely to
suffer from heart disease

00:32:51.818 --> 00:32:53.252
Diabetes words

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:58.368
Heart disease is twice as
common as the average person

00:32:58.624 --> 00:33:01.027
Did you see the back?

00:33:01.051 --> 00:33:02.720
I just thought about it

00:33:02.976 --> 00:33:05.024
postmenopausal women

00:33:05.536 --> 00:33:09.134
This is about our girls

00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:11.425
because of menopause

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.496
Our estrogen will decrease

00:33:14.752 --> 00:33:19.104
Estrogen protects our cardiovascular system

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.456
when menopause comes

00:33:23.807 --> 00:33:26.007
How can we protect our
cardiovascular system

00:33:26.741 --> 00:33:28.141
Have you ever thought about

00:33:31.392 --> 00:33:36.256
At this time, we can consume
more beans after menopause

00:33:36.768 --> 00:33:42.400
Soy beans and black beans are the
estrogen that women's bodies are good for

00:33:42.656 --> 00:33:43.936
not bad

00:33:44.514 --> 00:33:50.658
So we can also add more
beans when menopause comes.

00:33:52.477 --> 00:33:54.910
Then for the high-risk group just mentioned

00:33:55.272 --> 00:33:57.938
he is lifting heavy objects

00:33:58.751 --> 00:34:00.329
after eating

00:34:00.395 --> 00:34:03.392
are prone to myocardial infarction

00:34:03.648 --> 00:34:09.280
I would like to ask everyone
how full we have to eat each meal

00:34:11.584 --> 00:34:13.120
seven points full

00:34:13.376 --> 00:34:14.144
very good

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.936
and then

00:34:16.192 --> 00:34:22.056
Myocardial infarction is more likely to
occur when the weather is very cold and hot

00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:25.671
Then everyone will see it on TV

00:34:26.551 --> 00:34:29.584
when dad wants to kill his daughter

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:31.849
At that time, there
will be a myocardial

00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:34.112
infarction and you will
fall to the ground, right?

00:34:34.624 --> 00:34:37.696
What do you do when you are his daughter?

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:43.196
Save him, call 119, right?

00:34:43.883 --> 00:34:46.681
So how do we know about
our myocardial infarction?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.960
myocardial infarction it

00:34:49.216 --> 00:34:51.776
There must be some symptoms

00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:55.002
This exam is very important

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.020
His omen is

00:34:59.456 --> 00:35:02.272
left shoulder pain

00:35:03.552 --> 00:35:05.600
shortness of breath

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.777
will sweat

00:35:08.416 --> 00:35:09.952
Paled face

00:35:10.833 --> 00:35:12.033
These four symptoms

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:28.128
If you find out that someone
has another myocardial infarction

00:35:28.384 --> 00:35:30.944
I have all the symptoms I just mentioned.

00:35:31.968 --> 00:35:37.088
Usually a doctor with heart
disease will prescribe 1

00:35:37.299 --> 00:35:41.613
A small piece of medicine, you
can see the picture on our left

00:35:41.638 --> 00:35:42.988
There's a bottle of medicine on it

00:35:43.013 --> 00:35:46.251
Then look at this
bottle, it's really small.

00:35:46.276 --> 00:35:48.283
He has 25 in it

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.646
he is ntg

00:35:50.752 --> 00:35:53.619
He is what people call a heart-saving pill.

00:35:55.264 --> 00:36:00.640
He is really small, so how should
he eat it? The doctor will tell you then

00:36:01.442 --> 00:36:04.711
That's basically when it happens

00:36:04.736 --> 00:36:08.320
You can pick one up
and put it under his tongue

00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:13.952
Because we have more
blood vessels under the tongue

00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:16.512
Then he will absorb better

00:36:16.537 --> 00:36:21.120
But if he still doesn't
get better after 5 minutes

00:36:21.573 --> 00:36:23.573
Then give him a second one

00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:29.824
This medicine is no
more than 3 pills at most.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.176
At this time, you have to help him quickly
call 119 and send him to the doctor.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.116
Then if you see him, you
can't take this medicine again

00:36:40.167 --> 00:36:43.233
He also passed out there,
no breathing, no heartbeat.

00:36:43.392 --> 00:36:47.232
At this time, you have to help
him do CPR as soon as possible.

00:36:51.072 --> 00:36:54.656
When we had a myocardial infarction

00:36:56.704 --> 00:36:58.240
most important thing

00:36:58.496 --> 00:37:01.654
Seek medical attention within 12 hours

00:37:01.679 --> 00:37:05.920
There will be two directions
for the doctor to help

00:37:06.176 --> 00:37:11.040
First, we will definitely do a blood
draw and an electrocardiogram.

00:37:11.383 --> 00:37:13.650
Then there is the drug treatment

00:37:14.112 --> 00:37:15.904
What if not

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.765
Because we may have a
blood clot in the blood vessel

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:26.190
So the doctor will prescribe aspirin
for you. Have you heard of aspirin?

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.520
He works great but the problem is

00:37:31.776 --> 00:37:33.568
he has side effects

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:36.873
part of the heart

00:37:37.152 --> 00:37:37.920
He has

00:37:38.176 --> 00:37:43.657
Another is because he inhibits thrombosis

00:37:43.724 --> 00:37:46.880
means that our blood does not clot easily

00:37:47.136 --> 00:37:53.280
What to do when we get hurt
and the blood doesn't clot easily

00:37:54.586 --> 00:37:59.185
Aspirin is not easy to clot blood

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.472
then i'm hurt

00:38:01.698 --> 00:38:04.393
We have no way to stop the
bleeding. Usually, we can put

00:38:04.405 --> 00:38:07.065
pressure on it for a minute
or two to stop the bleeding.

00:38:07.872 --> 00:38:14.016
Then it may be pressurized
for 5 to 10 minutes

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.403
So if you pressurize a
wound for 5 to 10 minutes

00:38:16.832 --> 00:38:22.976
What do you do if you can't stop the
bleeding for another 15 to 20 minutes?

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:29.868
It's very simple, go directly
to the hospital, tell the doctor

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.207
that I can't stop the bleeding,
ask the doctor to help me

00:38:33.232 --> 00:38:36.440
Otherwise how long will we be there?

00:38:37.312 --> 00:38:41.152
The other is that we will have a
cardiac catheterization intervention.

00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:46.506
Do you know what a blood vessel is?

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.009
What is a blood vessel

00:38:53.587 --> 00:38:55.800
Brother, how do you know

00:38:56.512 --> 00:39:00.352
Let's watch the video

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.768
I just told you how many blood
vessels we have in our heart

00:40:01.708 --> 00:40:07.168
Not bad, then if I put this bracket,
there will be at most a few at most

00:40:10.718 --> 00:40:13.609
40 records No

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:16.643
It is mainly these three

00:40:16.896 --> 00:40:21.248
But he may still be blocked

00:40:21.658 --> 00:40:26.567
So if someone told you
that he had 5 catheters

00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:30.976
in a hospital, do you
think it's possible?

00:40:31.945 --> 00:40:34.479
Because the largest blood vessel has only 3

00:40:35.038 --> 00:40:45.796
Therefore, only three blood vessels
can be passed through at most.

00:40:48.896 --> 00:40:50.688
I want to ask everyone

00:40:50.944 --> 00:40:54.016
If a person suddenly fell
down in front of the inside today

00:40:55.514 --> 00:40:59.714
If someone in our company
falls down in front of you

00:41:02.976 --> 00:41:05.536
turn a blind eye

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.192
Let's go and see if he's still breathing

00:41:13.195 --> 00:41:14.529
or call him

00:41:16.113 --> 00:41:20.546
If it's someone you know,
you should call him a little bit.

00:41:21.664 --> 00:41:24.736
Then this is our public
version of CPR and AED

00:41:30.482 --> 00:41:32.915
The first call is to call the patient

00:41:33.184 --> 00:41:38.048
But we have to make sure before we save him

00:41:38.304 --> 00:41:42.516
Is our environment safe
because we can't put

00:41:42.528 --> 00:41:46.471
ourselves in a dangerous
place to save her

00:41:46.496 --> 00:41:49.568
Just like the hanging job just now

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:56.223
You see that there's already a hang up
there. We can't go down there and help him.

00:41:56.479 --> 00:42:00.063
Because of this we have another risk

00:42:00.575 --> 00:42:05.951
If that thing falls and we're hurt,
how are we going to save him?

00:42:06.975 --> 00:42:07.743
it is good

00:42:07.999 --> 00:42:11.327
After confirming the
environment, we will call

00:42:12.255 --> 00:42:13.988
pat him on the shoulder

00:42:14.911 --> 00:42:19.519
I had a lovely colleague
in my first aid class

00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:22.335
He told me what to call him

00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:24.872
Guess what his name is

00:42:26.431 --> 00:42:30.271
He told me he would straddle that man

00:42:31.011 --> 00:42:32.811
then face him

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:36.415
Hands towards him and slap him

00:42:37.439 --> 00:42:39.743
You shouldn't do that

00:42:40.938 --> 00:42:43.305
I was taken aback when I saw it

00:42:43.557 --> 00:42:46.423
I wonder why it's called like this

00:42:47.372 --> 00:42:50.791
Just pat his shoulders with both hands

00:42:50.816 --> 00:42:54.519
Ask him if he is okay, Mr.

00:42:54.544 --> 00:42:58.309
If he doesn't respond
and doesn't breathe at all

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.520
Now we're going to have a second call.

00:43:03.129 --> 00:43:05.162
The second call is call help

00:43:06.465 --> 00:43:08.798
What if you were alone

00:43:09.183 --> 00:43:13.023
Just to call 119 because
you can't see anyone around

00:43:13.276 --> 00:43:17.610
We must call the second one to save him

00:43:17.887 --> 00:43:20.447
If there are two people

00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:22.495
you can ask him

00:43:22.751 --> 00:43:24.031
Call 119 for you

00:43:24.562 --> 00:43:29.129
Then you start helping him do CPR,
and the person who called 119 for you?

00:43:29.407 --> 00:43:32.735
You need to ask him to find AED by the way.

00:43:33.094 --> 00:43:37.394
Everyone must be wondering
how to find AEDs outside

00:43:37.732 --> 00:43:38.999
Have you ever thought about

00:43:39.647 --> 00:43:43.430
In fact, I found that there
are many AEDs outside,

00:43:43.442 --> 00:43:46.790
if you are not familiar
with this environment

00:43:47.071 --> 00:43:48.863
There is an AED App

00:43:49.192 --> 00:43:50.492
can go to download

00:43:53.215 --> 00:43:56.287
It's called Piezoelectric

00:43:56.645 --> 00:43:59.359
It's a chest press

00:43:59.615 --> 00:44:05.759
Do you know where to
press the chest is correct?

00:44:08.734 --> 00:44:13.984
The public version is relatively
simple between the nipples

00:44:15.137 --> 00:44:17.837
If it is the medical staff version

00:44:18.357 --> 00:44:21.631
Two horizontal fingers
on the xiphoid process

00:44:22.068 --> 00:44:25.602
The public version is that you can
directly press between the two nipples

00:44:25.874 --> 00:44:31.207
Do you know how to pose CPR gestures?

00:44:34.175 --> 00:44:37.247
You can lend me both hands

00:44:38.527 --> 00:44:41.343
A hand during our CPR

00:44:41.637 --> 00:44:42.879
it opens like this

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:44.927
what about the other hand?

00:44:45.183 --> 00:44:45.951
meeting

00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:47.743
put this

00:44:47.999 --> 00:44:49.535
finger gap

00:44:50.047 --> 00:44:52.351
Then when we are under
normal pressure, we will

00:44:52.376 --> 00:44:56.411
Will do the pressing action
with the heel part of the palm

00:44:56.436 --> 00:44:58.846
Then our fingers will stick up.

00:44:58.871 --> 00:45:05.915
Because if you hadn't jumped up,
our whole point of force wouldn't be here

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:13.221
It is possible that all five fingers will
exert force and spread to five fingers

00:45:13.246 --> 00:45:16.962
Our bodies are vertical when we press

00:45:16.987 --> 00:45:21.258
The heel of the palm
retreats between his nipples

00:45:21.283 --> 00:45:23.016
Press like this

00:45:23.157 --> 00:45:25.990
Let's call it twice

00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:29.997
Remember our fingers are pointing upwards

00:45:31.596 --> 00:45:34.788
The finger is to be upwards,
so the action of pressing

00:45:40.479 --> 00:45:45.855
So if we say that we have
been pressing down on the AED

00:45:47.903 --> 00:45:50.719
What if you say you're tired

00:45:52.361 --> 00:45:55.561
Ask the next person to help you

00:45:57.198 --> 00:45:59.365
The AED

00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:02.239
Our company has two AEDs

00:46:02.495 --> 00:46:04.543
Both AEDs are the same

00:46:04.967 --> 00:46:08.567
Our step is to open the post

00:46:08.921 --> 00:46:11.967
Wait a minute and
you'll hear it on the video

00:46:12.223 --> 00:46:18.486
The AED that is plugged in is another model

00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:21.991
If it is different, then our
company will issue a call

00:46:22.463 --> 00:46:26.815
Opening the AED's box is the
same as turning on our power

00:46:27.071 --> 00:46:30.655
Do you know where to post it?

00:46:30.983 --> 00:46:36.683
If you don't know, the sticker
will tell you where to put it

00:46:36.996 --> 00:46:40.333
what we normal people want to post

00:46:40.358 --> 00:46:46.284
One is attached under our right collarbone

00:46:47.524 --> 00:46:50.257
You should have felt your collarbone.

00:46:50.872 --> 00:46:52.538
Tell me if you haven't touched it

00:46:53.264 --> 00:46:55.630
The right clavicle should be there.

00:46:57.074 --> 00:47:01.508
If the other piece, we will stick
it on the side of the left nipple

00:47:03.935 --> 00:47:09.311
When the patch on our AED is turned
on, the patch will tell you where to put it

00:47:09.436 --> 00:47:11.203
don't worry

00:47:11.403 --> 00:47:14.336
For the children, because
their body size is relatively small

00:47:14.687 --> 00:47:16.991
So he is the part before and after the post

00:47:18.248 --> 00:47:23.093
If the electricity is used, everyone
knows that it is to shock him.

00:47:23.252 --> 00:47:25.252
What if before the shock

00:47:25.366 --> 00:47:27.100
to tell everyone

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:30.711
Please leave or everyone
will be called by you together

00:47:31.071 --> 00:47:32.863
Because people are also conductive

00:47:34.968 --> 00:47:36.934
Then let's watch the video

00:49:47.007 --> 00:49:50.335
I want to ask everyone

00:49:50.908 --> 00:49:52.895
This topic is also important

00:49:54.139 --> 00:49:57.106
Excuse me, where is our company's AED?

00:49:57.916 --> 00:49:59.416
can you tell me

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:01.855
What about the restaurant?

00:50:04.487 --> 00:50:06.087
where else

00:50:06.463 --> 00:50:07.999
see pictures and tell stories

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:09.535
Did you see

00:50:10.047 --> 00:50:11.327
except the restaurant

00:50:12.351 --> 00:50:16.191
There are also two places in
the health center that have AEDs.

00:50:18.751 --> 00:50:22.079
This is the item inside our AED

00:50:22.335 --> 00:50:24.383
stickers included

00:50:24.639 --> 00:50:25.919
And the battery

00:50:26.588 --> 00:50:29.821
Do you think this first aid kit is strange?

00:50:30.274 --> 00:50:31.507
why he needs scissors

00:50:32.274 --> 00:50:33.674
Why does Aed need scissors

00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:38.866
cut clothes pair

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:40.703
Then why the razor

00:50:42.146 --> 00:50:42.812
why

00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:47.438
Do some guys have thick chest hair?

00:50:47.957 --> 00:50:49.990
Because I'm afraid you'll get hairy

00:50:50.732 --> 00:50:53.265
Then his conductive
effect will also deviate

00:50:53.567 --> 00:50:54.591
So if say

00:50:54.847 --> 00:50:58.175
If you cut his clothes and
found a lot of hair on his chest

00:50:58.431 --> 00:51:00.991
Don't be rude, just shave him

00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:04.075
because to save him

00:51:04.941 --> 00:51:07.516
So what I want to share with you is this

00:51:07.734 --> 00:51:17.600
If today you find that the fallen person
is covered with water or around him

00:51:18.201 --> 00:51:20.968
please move it to a dry place

00:51:21.152 --> 00:51:23.673
Also wipe the water off him

00:51:24.031 --> 00:51:26.591
Because everyone should also know
that water conducts electricity, right?

00:51:28.383 --> 00:51:29.663
I just said

00:51:30.431 --> 00:51:34.527
Do not touch the patient during the shock

00:51:35.039 --> 00:51:38.872
Water is also a conductive
material, so please

00:51:38.897 --> 00:51:45.408
Wipe the water off him and move it to a dry
place before you can do the electric shock.

00:51:46.047 --> 00:51:49.975
If you have high blood pressure,
you just stopped for about

00:51:49.987 --> 00:51:53.796
an hour. Do you feel that
high blood pressure is terrible?

00:51:54.495 --> 00:51:57.823
Affects many, many organs of the body

00:51:58.335 --> 00:52:00.895
So everyone, take good care of your body

00:52:02.431 --> 00:52:04.735
That's it for today's class, thank you all
