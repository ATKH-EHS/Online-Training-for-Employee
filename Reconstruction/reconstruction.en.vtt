00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:03.699
Every Occupational Accident Worker

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:07.700
They all have a story of
their own and their destiny.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.033
Labor laws are so much today

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.366
In the end occupational
accident workers can

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.366
What should be covered by
employer or labor insurance, etc.

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:22.366
Kaohsiung City Government
Labor Bureau for assistance

00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:24.700
A worker friend who suffered
an occupational accident

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:27.366
Simple and fast instant instant self-rights

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.700
Filming a series of occupational
accident workers rights videos

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.330
It is hoped that in an
easy-to-understand way,

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:35.700
people will be exposed
to occupational disasters

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.700
Can know how to
fight for relevant labor rights

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.366
so-called occupational disaster

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.699
refers to the labor caused by the workplace

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.699
Work activities and other
reasons for performing duties

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.033
Including commuting and public travel

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.282
Sickness, injury, disability
or death caused by

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Classification of occupational hazards

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:14.033
- Occupational injury in the
course of performing duties

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:18.033
2. Risk factors of
long-term exposure to work

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.366
causally related to the injury

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.033
leading to occupational diseases

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.070
You can apply for an
occupational disease ship through

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:29.700
the Occupational Injury
Prevention and Control Center

00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:34.391
Labor is always the most
important part of urban development

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700
Since the promulgation of the Labor
Standards Act in 1974, Taiwan has

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:44.874
A series of special laws
have been formulated

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.366
In order to improve working conditions and
protect the rights and interests of workers

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.033
Improve the occupational
disaster prevention system

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.700
But in the unfortunate event
of an occupational accident

00:01:56.033 --> 00:02:00.700
About your labor rights
and resources to seek help

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:05.033
will be the key to your return to work

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.366
I will always remember that day

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.366
It's Father's Day on August 8th

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.366
I do stamping work

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.700
At that time I remember that I was feeding

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.366
I don't know why

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.366
The punch suddenly
becomes a continuous punch

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
can not stop

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.033
Because I can't get my hand out in time

00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:29.700
so caught

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:34.033
Later they said it was
because the punch machine was

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:38.700
Caused by loose screws of clutch parts

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:42.033
But it's too late to say that now

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.366
To assist with occupational disasters

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.366
causing family dysfunction

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.033
or working families with
circumstances in their lives

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:55.700
Immediate access to appropriate welfare
services resource intervention and support

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:58.700
Kaohsiung City Government Labor Bureau
in cooperation with the Ministry of Labor

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:04.366
Continue to promote the active service
plan for occupational accident labor cases

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.033
Set up a single service window

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:10.700
Occupational Disaster Case
Manager for Professional

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.366
One-to-one service

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.366
Provide free complete rights information
for workers with occupational accident

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.366
Combine labor benefits and social
welfare system and other related resources

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.033
to build a complete safety network

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:27.700
Implement the protection of labor rights

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.700
Accompanying workers and
families through the difficulties of life

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:37.366
I do this kind of traditional manufacturing

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.700
Where can I know what
should be called the Laoji law?

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.700
So when I got hurt

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:45.366
The only thought in my head is

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.700
gone

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.700
how should i take care of my family

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:49.366
The kids are still young

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.700
when i was in the hospital

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.033
The old pavilion also came once

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.033
It felt a bit

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:58.033
It seems that I don't want to go back

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:00.033
I really don't know what to do

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:02.366
Fortunately, the social worker
at the hospital is very kind

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.366
Tell me you can go to our
Kaohsiung City Labor Bureau for help

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.033
I just want to say that otherwise,
I'm desperate, let's try it out.

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:17.700
Later, the Department of Labor
hired a case manager to help me.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:19.033
Only then did I slowly know

00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:20.700
There are subsidies available

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.033
What about sick leave?

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:25.033
Work rights are stipulated

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.366
The point is that the boss
can't get hurt because of my job

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.033
Just ask me to quit

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:31.869
In the end, it was the
occupational disaster

00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:33.700
supervisor who helped me
apply for labor consultation.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.033
Otherwise, how can I do it alone?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.366
According to my country's
current labor standards law

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.033
When a worker is injured or
suffers from an occupational disease

00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:48.700
There are four main types of expenses
that employers should compensate for

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:52.033
Include medical reimbursement
at the time of medical treatment

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:56.033
Wage compensation for inability
to work during medical treatment

00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:58.700
Diagnosed by the hospital
according to the degree of disability

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:02.033
One-time disability compensation

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:05.033
and funeral expenses for death
due to occupational accident

00:05:05.366 --> 00:05:08.700
and one-time compensation
for death of survivors

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.033
The content of the labor
base law is also clearly defined

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:16.700
Compensation protection
and right to work protection

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.033
Protects workers during medical treatment

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:20.366
Employers may not dismiss without cause

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.700
and the rights to receive compensation
can be exercised within two years

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:27.877
Seriously

00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:32.033
I was actually worried at first
about going to the labor office for help

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:35.366
It seems that it will become the feeling
that I want to tear my old pavilion apart

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.033
I learned later

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:38.700
Lao Ge and staff

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:41.366
have their own rights and obligations

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:45.033
We work so hard every day for our family

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:50.033
but was injured at work

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.700
This kind of thing doesn't
matter if it's your own life

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:54.366
or for family

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.033
It's a big blow

00:05:56.366 --> 00:06:00.033
Ho Plus provides complete occupational
disaster protection in the government

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:02.033
Let me get up slowly

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:03.997
Therefore, regarding
the rights and interests

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.366
of workers with
occupational accidents

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.700
I really don't know

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.366
In order to effectively implement
the laws related to labor conditions

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.700
and assist workers

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.700
Protect your rights against theft in
accordance with relevant labor laws

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:21.366
Accident workers can call the
Kaohsiung City Government Labor Bureau

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.700
Labor-based law service line

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:28.700
ext 232, 233, 234

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:32.700
Or go directly to the Labor Conditions
Section on the 7th floor for consultation

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:34.033
in addition

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.033
If there is a need for
labor dispute mediation

00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:38.087
You can also contact
the Complaint Service

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.033
Center on the first floor
to apply for mediation

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.700
Our work is mainly to ensure
that both employers and employees

00:06:45.033 --> 00:06:47.033
in accordance with the Labor Standards Act

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.700
Especially the part of
occupational accident compensation

00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:54.700
When an employer or a worker
friend does not understand this part

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:57.033
when the right to lose

00:06:57.366 --> 00:06:59.700
For workers who suffer
from occupational accidents

00:07:00.033 --> 00:07:02.033
Undoubtedly a worrisome

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:05.033
Many families are even caught
in the situation because of this

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:06.700
The Kaohsiung City Government Labor Bureau

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:09.033
A lot of effort has been made in this part

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:11.366
Whether it is the establishment
of a single service window

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.033
or various counseling services

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:15.700
If there are labor friends who need balls

00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:18.033
When you encounter related problems

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:19.700
You can come to us directly

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:21.033
Let us assist you

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:23.033
Can overcome difficulties
and return to work

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.366
either employer or worker

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.700
When in doubt about the relevant laws

00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:32.366
or unfamiliarity with
litigation procedures, etc.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.700
The Labour Office has also hired
lawyers from the Legal Aid Foundation.

00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:39.373
Provide free consulting services

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.366
In addition, according to
relevant laws and regulations

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.949
When a labor dispute
cannot be mediated through

00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:47.033
mediation, it is
necessary to file a lawsuit

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.700
Labor friends with financial difficulties

00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:55.366
You can also apply for legal and
living expenses support separately

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.366
We have met many labor friends
who suffered occupational accidents

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.033
Worried about getting to this
part of the lawsuit in the beginning

00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:05.366
Many people gave up
their rights because of this

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.700
What a pity

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:08.033
because in fact

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:11.033
Occupational injuries and
diseases of workers in Taiwan

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.366
death compensation system

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.700
insured workers

00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:17.033
Occupational Accident Compensation
Liability under the Labor Standards Act

00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:20.033
And labor insurance regulations
Occupational Accident Insurance Liability

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.033
to claim related rights

00:08:22.366 --> 00:08:23.700
uninsured people

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:26.366
Occupational Accident Labor Protection Act

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.033
to provide relevant guarantees

00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:31.131
The Kaohsiung City
Government also has measures

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:33.033
for occupational
disaster consolation funds

00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:34.366
That is to say

00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:37.366
Rights and Compensation for
Occupational Accident Workers

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.033
At present, there are clear
and sound legal provisions

00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:44.366
Based on the litigation costs that
many labor friends are worried about

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.366
and living expenses during the litigation

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.033
In fact, as long as you qualify

00:08:48.366 --> 00:08:49.366
Anyone can apply

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:51.033
By Kaohsiung City Government Labor Bureau

00:08:51.366 --> 00:08:53.033
Lawyer consulting services provided

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.033
and assistance with referral proceedings

00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:58.033
Helping you get the
labor rights you deserve

00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:00.033
Last but not least

00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:01.366
We are practical

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.033
Workers who often encounter
occupational accidents

00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:05.366
because I don't understand

00:09:05.366 --> 00:09:08.700
leading to the execution of a
so-called settlement with the employer

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:10.700
This may actually lead to subsequent

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:12.700
Loss of interest in
the relevant application

00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:14.700
Therefore, special reminder

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:16.033
If you don't understand

00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:18.302
You are also welcome
to visit the Kaohsiung City

00:09:18.314 --> 00:09:20.182
Government Labor Bureau

00:09:20.781 --> 00:09:22.542
According to the 108
Occupational Safety and

00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:24.366
Health Administration
of the Ministry of Labor

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:27.366
Labor inspection statistics
annual report shows

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.474
The type of disaster
that was caught and

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:33.612
caught accounted for
about 12.55% of the total

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.033
Kaohsiung City Government Labor Bureau

00:09:36.366 --> 00:09:38.366
Continue to comply with the
Occupational Safety and Health Act

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.033
Intensified inspections on the
stipulated working conditions

00:09:42.366 --> 00:09:44.700
Beyond advocacy and prevention

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:49.033
In the event of an occupational
disaster that no one wants to see

00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:51.366
Provide professional fast

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.033
and complete service resources

00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:57.033
Help our labor friends step by step

00:09:57.366 --> 00:09:59.366
Through occupational accident labor cases

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.700
Assistance with proactive service programs

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:04.366
A smooth return to work

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.033
Kaohsiung City Government Labor Bureau

00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:08.033
Invite you to come and learn

00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:11.366
Labor rights and interests
that are closely related to you

00:10:20.366 --> 00:10:22.366
Every occupational accident worker

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.366
They all have a story of
their own and their destiny.

00:10:30.033 --> 00:10:31.700
so many labor laws

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:34.700
In the end occupational
accident workers can

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:39.366
What is covered by employer
or labor insurance, etc.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.162
Kaohsiung City Government
Labor Bureau for assistance

00:10:44.674 --> 00:10:46.700
A worker friend who suffered
an occupational accident

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:49.700
Simple and fast airing of self-rights

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:53.366
Filming a series of occupational
accident workers rights videos

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.832
It is hoped that in an
easy-to-understand way,

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:58.033
people will be exposed
to occupational disasters

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:02.366
Can the dog know how to obtain
relevant labor rights and interests

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.033
so-called occupational disaster

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:10.366
refers to the labor caused by the workplace

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.366
Work activities and other
reasons for performing duties

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.700
Including commuting and public travel

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:21.366
Illness, injury, disability
or death of the induced leg

00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:26.366
Classification of occupational hazards

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.700
- Occupational injury in the
course of performing duties

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:36.700
2. Risk factors of
long-term exposure to work

00:11:37.033 --> 00:11:40.033
causally related to the injury

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.700
leading to occupational diseases

00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:45.737
You can apply for an
occupational disease ship through

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:48.366
the Occupational Injury
Prevention and Control Center

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.700
social insurance system

00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:58.033
a modern social security system

00:11:58.366 --> 00:11:59.700
by the power of the government

00:12:00.033 --> 00:12:02.033
formulate relevant legal norms

00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:04.700
Involve people in
various types of insurance

00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:08.700
Prepare for various social risks in advance

00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:10.033
of which

00:12:10.033 --> 00:12:11.366
Occupational Accident Insurance

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.700
It provides a perfect guarantee for
the occupational safety of workers

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:25.700
My husband works in formwork

00:12:26.033 --> 00:12:27.033
I heard from his colleague

00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:29.700
that day he was locking
the screws of the die

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:33.033
Due to limited space on site

00:12:33.366 --> 00:12:37.366
There are some screws to lock which
is difficult for one person to handle

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.366
He had asked another
nearby colleague to help

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.033
But that person is busy
because he also has work at hand

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.700
There is no way to help him right away

00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:52.033
My husband had to continue
to lock those screws by himself.

00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:54.700
It's been about half an hour.

00:12:55.366 --> 00:12:58.366
On the third floor, there is a
worker who is making a window.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.366
He suddenly heard several
loud banging noises in a row.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.700
So he ran over to see

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.033
My husband has fallen to the ground

00:13:06.366 --> 00:13:09.700
Many working friends are
the breadwinners of the family

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:12.366
So when a job disaster occurs

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.033
The family economy will soon be in trouble

00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:19.033
And occupational accident
insurance pays at this time

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:22.366
Relevant payment resources
can be provided in a timely manner

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.597
Assisting workers with
occupational disasters and

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:26.366
their families through
difficult circumstances

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.033
Howan's current occupational
accident insurance benefits

00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:31.033
Mainly divided into cash payment

00:13:31.366 --> 00:13:34.033
Two ways of payment in kind

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:36.033
Then according to the
individual status of the worker

00:13:36.366 --> 00:13:38.700
Provide corresponding payment items

00:13:42.699 --> 00:13:45.033
At that time, the hospital
notified the labor bureau

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.699
An occupational disaster case
manager volunteered to assist us

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:49.574
Honestly

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:51.033
We do not have labor insurance

00:13:51.366 --> 00:13:53.366
Wherever there is a
lack of work, we will do it

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:55.699
So you don't know until after it happened

00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:58.699
The current law restricts uninsured workers

00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:02.366
There are also related
grants and allowances

00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:04.390
Luckily, there's an
Occupational Disaster Case

00:14:04.402 --> 00:14:06.033
Manager from the
Department of Labor to help.

00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:07.366
let us solve

00:14:07.366 --> 00:14:11.033
It turns out that the government has
provided so many resources to use

00:14:11.366 --> 00:14:14.366
Otherwise, I really don't know what to do.

00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:19.033
In order to provide workers
with better protection

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:20.699
Occupational Accident Labor Protection Act

00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:23.033
Labor friends who will also not
add labor insurance for some reason

00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.366
Included in the coverage of
occupational accident insurance benefits

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.033
Provide uninsured labor friends

00:14:28.366 --> 00:14:30.366
occupational sickness living allowance

00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:31.699
Disability Living Allowance

00:14:32.033 --> 00:14:33.699
Vocational Training Living Allowance

00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:35.033
Appliance subsidy

00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:36.033
Nursing allowance

00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:37.033
family allowance

00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:39.033
Disability allowance
without labor insurance

00:14:39.366 --> 00:14:40.699
Add labor insurance death benefit

00:14:41.033 --> 00:14:44.699
and occupational disaster subsidy programs
such as auxiliary facilities subsidy

00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:48.033
For laborers based in Kaohsiung City

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:49.366
Kaohsiung City Government also has

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:52.699
Kaohsiung City Labor and Occupational
Accident Consolation Payment Measures

00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:56.033
Come to help the families of workers who
are disabled due to occupational accidents

00:14:56.366 --> 00:14:58.033
return to normal life

00:14:59.033 --> 00:15:00.699
Actually, I think a lot
of people are like me

00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:02.366
Didn't read the book

00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:05.366
Go online to see what the law says

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:06.699
really no way

00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.366
So I would suggest saying

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.699
If you have friends who have needs like me

00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:12.699
Just go to the labor office.

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:18.366
As I learned this time with the help of
a professional disaster case manager

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:22.699
I am very grateful to the government
for taking care of us uninsured workers

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:25.366
So let's still apply for some

00:15:25.699 --> 00:15:27.699
like a caregiver grant

00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:29.366
Disability Living Allowance

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:32.699
And the incapacitated consolation allowance
issued by our Kaohsiung City Government

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.033
deeply appreciated

00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:40.033
Generally speaking

00:15:40.366 --> 00:15:42.033
Items covered by
occupational accident insurance

00:15:42.366 --> 00:15:44.366
Included can be used to
pay for outpatient clinics

00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:47.366
and medical benefits for hospitalization

00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:49.929
When you are unable
to work due to treatment

00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:52.033
and have not received
your original salary

00:15:52.366 --> 00:15:55.033
Claimable Injury Benefit

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:57.033
In addition, there are losses to pay

00:15:57.366 --> 00:15:59.699
and death benefit

00:16:00.033 --> 00:16:02.699
Occupational disasters
for farmers and fishermen

00:16:03.033 --> 00:16:04.917
There are also related
occupational accident

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:06.699
insurance benefits
that can be applied for

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.033
people in need

00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:11.699
You can contact the relevant
travel agency to consult

00:16:12.033 --> 00:16:15.033
Modern people can generally
agree with insurance planning

00:16:15.366 --> 00:16:16.699
The concept of a rainy day

00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:19.699
Started on January 1, 1998

00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:22.033
Implement the labor
insurance annuity system

00:16:22.366 --> 00:16:25.699
Three benefits in
disability old age and death

00:16:26.033 --> 00:16:29.033
More ways to receive annuity every month

00:16:29.366 --> 00:16:31.699
old age pension

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.366
Disability Annuity

00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:36.033
Three types of benefits
and survivors' annuity

00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:38.366
So there is labor insurance annuity

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:42.366
Labor friends will get better
protection of rights and interests

00:16:43.699 --> 00:16:44.699
don't believe it easily

00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:47.252
The person who takes
the initiative to help you say

00:16:47.264 --> 00:16:49.366
that you want to pay the
insurance on your behalf

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:52.366
These are the so-called
labor insurance scalpers

00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:54.366
in a deceptive way

00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:57.033
To handle payment application procedures

00:16:57.366 --> 00:16:59.699
Then take high commissions

00:16:59.699 --> 00:17:02.366
This is very unreasonable for your rights

00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:05.700
So call on labor friends in need

00:17:06.033 --> 00:17:07.700
through the consultation line

so many labor laws

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:24.033
In the end occupational
accident workers can

00:18:24.366 --> 00:18:28.033
What is covered by employer
or labor insurance, etc.

00:18:28.646 --> 00:18:31.327
Kaohsiung City Government
Labor Bureau for assistance

00:18:31.366 --> 00:18:33.032
A worker friend who suffered
an occupational accident

00:18:33.366 --> 00:18:35.700
Simple and fast airing of self-rights

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.366
Filming a series of occupational
accident workers rights videos

00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:42.165
It is hoped that in an
easy-to-understand way,

00:18:42.177 --> 00:18:44.366
people will be exposed
to occupational disasters

00:18:45.033 --> 00:18:48.366
Be able to know how to
fight for relevant labor rights

00:18:49.366 --> 00:18:51.033
so-called occupational disaster

00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:53.366
refers to the labor caused by the workplace

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.366
Work activities and other
reasons for performing duties

00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:00.366
Including commuting and public travel

00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:05.033
Sickness, injury, disability
or death caused by

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.033
Classification of occupational hazards

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.700
- Occupational injury in the
course of performing duties

00:19:15.033 --> 00:19:18.700
2. Risk factors of
long-term exposure to work

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:21.366
causally related to the injury

00:19:22.366 --> 00:19:24.366
leading to occupational diseases

00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:27.212
You can apply for occupational
disease identification

00:19:27.224 --> 00:19:29.700
through the Occupational Injury
and Disease Prevention Center

00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:36.033
the first time i saw lobule in the hospital

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:39.033
Found out he was very young in his 20s

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.366
Xiaoye was originally a delivery
driver in a material company.

00:19:44.925 --> 00:19:46.700
It's hard work, the pay is not high

00:19:46.965 --> 00:19:49.033
But because my baby was just born

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.366
The wife must take
care of the child at home

00:19:52.288 --> 00:19:55.033
So he has been working
hard to support his family

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.033
As a result, on the way to work one day

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.366
Hit by an inverse locomotive

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.366
Injury caused by lumbar disc herniation

00:20:04.243 --> 00:20:05.700
The throbbing pain that
comes with the swelling

00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:08.366
Make him so painful that he can't walk

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:11.366
Even in the middle of the
night will be woken up in pain

00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:19.033
It took a big hit in his
mood and family life.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.366
I really didn't know what to do at the time

00:20:22.023 --> 00:20:25.033
The constant pain makes it
almost hard for me to think too much

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:28.366
Even walking is a big problem for me

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.700
Later, a supervisor from the labor
bureau took the initiative to contact me.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.033
In addition to explaining some
related rights and interests to me

00:20:37.033 --> 00:20:39.366
And slowly began to explain something to me

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.700
About the process and
method of career reconstruction

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.700
That's when I knew

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.700
It turns out that the government has
many resources for career reconstruction

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:52.033
Assist workers in occupational disasters
to return to the workplace smoothly

00:20:54.033 --> 00:20:57.366
Xiaoye's situation was
really urgent in life at first.

00:20:58.366 --> 00:21:00.700
Originally, the parents could barely help.

00:21:01.366 --> 00:21:02.700
But the baby was born soon

00:21:03.366 --> 00:21:05.033
Parents also have debt problems

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.033
house under foreclosure

00:21:07.479 --> 00:21:10.033
Therefore, there is an immediate need
for emergency assistance in the economy.

00:21:10.897 --> 00:21:13.033
In order to make Xiao Ye feel at ease first

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.706
Therefore, we first assisted
in reporting the services

00:21:15.718 --> 00:21:17.700
of the social bureau for
high-risk vulnerable families

00:21:18.298 --> 00:21:20.366
And Dan Referral Social Welfare Resources

00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:22.700
Temporary emergency assistance

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.700
Gradually stabilize the
economy of the lobular family

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.033
The next step is in the
medical process of the lobule.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.366
We also started planning for
functional rehabilitation services

00:21:35.033 --> 00:21:39.366
Because we know that the current
condition can be treated with surgery

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:43.033
Therefore, post-operative rehabilitation
and work-intensive assistance

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.033
will be a critical part
of returning to work

00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:49.033
Occupational disaster occupational
reconstruction is mainly divided into

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.574
social rehabilitation,
functional rehabilitation

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.033
and the three major
parts of career rebuilding

00:21:55.366 --> 00:21:58.033
The purpose of social
rehabilitation is to protect

00:21:58.366 --> 00:22:01.366
Minimum living conditions for workers
with occupational injuries and illnesses

00:22:02.366 --> 00:22:06.033
with the goal of restoring the
social life function before the injury

00:22:07.366 --> 00:22:09.033
Special Committee by Case Manager

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.033
Yutani utilizes county and city resources

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:13.393
Provide occupational
accident workers with

00:22:13.405 --> 00:22:15.033
consultation and protection
on rights and interests

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:21.366
Legal Assistance, Labour Disputes
Office, Family Services and Medical Care

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.366
Welfare resource links and more

00:22:24.366 --> 00:22:27.055
Functional rehabilitation is to

00:22:27.366 --> 00:22:31.366
Workers who suffer from occupational
injuries can get effective treatment

00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:36.033
Early recovery of pre-injury
employment status and return to work

00:22:37.033 --> 00:22:38.727
Therefore, the
committee will appoint a

00:22:38.739 --> 00:22:40.700
medical unit to handle
medical rehabilitation.

00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:44.366
Work ability assessment,
work intensive training

00:22:45.033 --> 00:22:47.033
and return to work assistance

00:22:49.366 --> 00:22:52.033
Form for Workers with
Disability Certificate

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:56.366
Kaohsiung City Government Labor
Bureau Fraternity Skills Training Center

00:22:57.033 --> 00:22:59.700
Career Rebuild Services will be available

00:23:00.033 --> 00:23:04.033
Vocational Counseling Assessment,
Vocational Training, Employment Services

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.033
Service projects such as job
redesign and entrepreneurial counseling

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.366
Surgery completed and medical
rehabilitation for some time

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.033
some time to recover

00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:19.033
The manager helped me

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.366
Arrange the work of our hospital to
strengthen the training of the center

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.033
Initially the therapist assessed
my work situation needs

00:23:30.366 --> 00:23:32.033
Follow me on my current recovery

00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:36.033
A training plan is then
drawn up and explained

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.033
Then start working on
things like the core muscles

00:23:41.366 --> 00:23:45.366
And basic training such as
lower limb muscle strength training

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.033
Then gradually add some
work simulation training, etc.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.033
I'm actually a bit lucky

00:23:56.033 --> 00:23:58.366
The boss of the company is
willing to help me adjust my position

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.366
Because the original delivery
job will require heavy lifting

00:24:03.366 --> 00:24:05.033
Not good for the recovery of my spine

00:24:06.033 --> 00:24:09.700
So there is a job to help me
adjust to the quality inspection.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.366
It just takes longer to sit

00:24:13.033 --> 00:24:15.033
Low back pain after sitting for a long time

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.366
After the therapist found out, he went to
our company to see the working environment

00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:25.700
Assisted me with the application to make
a work desk and high chair that suits me

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.700
It really helped me a lot at work

00:24:30.366 --> 00:24:33.033
When our disaster worker friends came here

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.700
We usually do a job analysis
and competency assessment first

00:24:37.033 --> 00:24:41.366
Then set up a training plan for
the part that is not yet up to the job

00:24:42.033 --> 00:24:44.033
Usually start with job fitness training

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.366
such as increasing joint
mobility and muscle strength

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.366
Slowly let some limbs move

00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:54.700
Or after the ability of balance and
proprioception has been restored

00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:58.033
Then we will move on to the next
stage of job simulation training.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.365
The main difference
between work intensive

00:25:00.377 --> 00:25:02.366
training and general
medical rehabilitation is that

00:25:03.033 --> 00:25:04.812
Medical rehabilitation
is generally known

00:25:04.824 --> 00:25:06.700
as physical therapy
and occupational therapy

00:25:07.033 --> 00:25:11.366
Then he focused on improving the
pathological problems caused by injuries.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.033
such as pain management,
improved joint mobility

00:25:15.366 --> 00:25:17.700
and general life training
such as muscle strength

00:25:18.366 --> 00:25:20.366
Low relevance to work situation

00:25:21.033 --> 00:25:24.033
Work-intensive training, on
the other hand, is goal-oriented

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.033
A job analysis will be done first

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.700
For the part that is difficult for
workers to perform work activities

00:25:30.366 --> 00:25:33.033
By simulating the tools
needed for actual work

00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:35.700
Materials, Actions, and Work Steps

00:25:36.366 --> 00:25:40.366
Lu may have created situations
and actions similar to the original work

00:25:41.033 --> 00:25:43.698
Achieving the skills,
physical fitness and behaviors

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.033
required to train
occupational workers to work

00:25:46.366 --> 00:25:47.366
in addition

00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:48.700
For example we have some labor friends

00:25:49.033 --> 00:25:51.033
would need assistance with job redesign

00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:53.033
To design some suitable accessories

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.700
enhance his work efficiency

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:56.700
This is where we can help

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.235
And for workers who are
in occupational disaster

00:25:59.247 --> 00:26:00.700
who cannot return to
their original workplaces

00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:04.700
We can also switch careers with the
help of career coaching assessments

00:26:05.033 --> 00:26:07.700
These resources can be used properly

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:09.944
Therefore, we hope that
labor friends who talk about

00:26:09.956 --> 00:26:11.366
occupational accidents
will not be discouraged.

00:26:12.033 --> 00:26:15.366
Through Functional Rehabilitation
and Vocational Rehabilitation Services

00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:18.700
It can effectively help you return to
the workplace as soon as possible

00:26:19.366 --> 00:26:23.033
Work reinforcement is three
systematic exercise training activities

00:26:24.033 --> 00:26:25.033
in a progressive manner

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.700
Increase Occupational Labor Neuromuscular

00:26:28.366 --> 00:26:30.366
Cardiovascular and other functions

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.033
and focus on real or simulated work

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.700
Can't be enforced after a worker's accident

00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:41.366
or projects or actions that do not
meet the job competency requirements

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:43.700
Intensive training

00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:46.229
So that workers can
finally return to their original

00:26:46.241 --> 00:26:48.366
workplaces and be
competent for their original jobs

00:26:49.033 --> 00:26:51.366
The current location of work
intensive training in Kaohsiung City

00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:53.033
There are four main places

00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:56.700
Welcome labor friends in
need to come and consult

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:58.366
Eligible

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.366
free training

00:27:02.033 --> 00:27:03.033
Occupational Accidents

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.033
It's often what we don't like

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.366
But when a job disaster happens

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.033
How to protect labor rights

00:27:11.366 --> 00:27:13.033
Provides referrals for
occupational injuries

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.366
and resource links for
Career Rehabilitation Services

00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:18.366
Assist in labor dispute mediation

00:27:19.033 --> 00:27:20.820
Referral to occupational
disaster comfort rooms and

00:27:20.832 --> 00:27:22.700
follow-up care resources
for workers' family functions

00:27:23.366 --> 00:27:25.033
and return to work related assistance

00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:28.033
For every worker who suffers
from an occupational accident

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.700
are very important

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.366
So we are looking forward to

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.700
through the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration

00:27:35.366 --> 00:27:37.366
Active Service Plan for
Occupational Accident Worker Cases

00:27:38.366 --> 00:27:40.700
Professionally trained
occupational disaster managers

00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:43.366
Come and refer our labor friends

00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:45.700
More diversified and multi-faceted services

00:27:46.366 --> 00:27:47.886
Assist more workers
with occupational disasters

00:27:47.898 --> 00:27:49.366
to return to the workplace
as soon as possible

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.700
Every occupational accident worker

00:28:02.366 --> 00:28:06.033
They all have a story of
their own and their destiny.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.033
so many labor laws

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.033
In the end occupational
accident workers can

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.700
What is covered by employer
or labor insurance, etc.

00:28:16.033 --> 00:28:18.366
Kaohsiung City Government
Labor Bureau for assistance

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.366
A worker friend who suffered
an occupational accident

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.366
Simple and fast airing of self-rights

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.033
Filming a series of occupational
accident workers rights videos

00:28:27.366 --> 00:28:29.663
It is hoped that in an
easy-to-understand way,

00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:32.033
people will be exposed
to occupational disasters

00:28:32.366 --> 00:28:35.700
Be able to know how to fight
for relevant labor rights spillovers

00:28:37.366 --> 00:28:38.700
so-called occupational disaster

00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:41.033
refers to the labor caused by the workplace

00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:45.366
Work activities and other
reasons for performing duties

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.366
Including commuting and public travel

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.033
resulting illness,
injury, disability or death

00:28:54.033 --> 00:28:56.700
Classification of occupational hazards

00:28:57.033 --> 00:29:03.033
- Occupational injury in the
course of performing duties

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:07.033
2. Risk factors of
long-term exposure to work

00:29:07.366 --> 00:29:10.700
causally related to the injury

00:29:11.033 --> 00:29:13.366
leading to occupational diseases

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.404
You can apply for an
occupational disease ship through

00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:19.033
the Occupational Injury
Prevention and Control Center

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.700
Occupational Accidents

00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:25.033
not only cause financial loss

00:29:26.033 --> 00:29:28.495
It can also cause physical
or mental health problems

00:29:28.507 --> 00:29:30.700
for workers involved in
occupational accidents.

00:29:31.366 --> 00:29:35.366
lead to the inability to use their
pre-injury productivity and work ability

00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:38.033
even unemployment

00:29:39.033 --> 00:29:41.700
And then derived many
family economic difficulties

00:29:42.366 --> 00:29:44.700
and social readjustment

00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:46.366
therefore

00:29:46.366 --> 00:29:50.033
How to Plan Medical Care for
Occupational Accident Workers

00:29:51.033 --> 00:29:53.033
and provide appropriate
resumption arrangements

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.033
Undoubtedly an important
topic after occupational disasters

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.700
Generally speaking

00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:01.366
When our Occupational Accident
Worker Treatment stabilizes

00:30:02.033 --> 00:30:04.700
can begin to enter the
so-called recovery phase

00:30:08.033 --> 00:30:09.461
The focus of management
at this time will be on

00:30:09.473 --> 00:30:11.033
preparations and arrangements
for resumption of work

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.324
In order to grasp the
post-illness situation of different

00:30:14.336 --> 00:30:16.700
injuries and the possible
risks of returning to work

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.700
So there will be a career
rebuilding program at this time.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.700
Include career coaching assessments

00:30:24.033 --> 00:30:26.366
Psychological counselling
and social adaptation

00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:29.366
Job Intensive Training, Job Redesign

00:30:30.366 --> 00:30:32.033
Vocational training,
employment services, etc.

00:30:33.366 --> 00:30:35.418
Whole-person
assessment and training of

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.700
physical, psychological
and social functions

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.366
Assist workers to return to work

00:30:41.366 --> 00:30:41.864
also

00:30:41.931 --> 00:30:46.033
Career rebuilding plans can be developed
and executed by case management

00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:48.366
Links to related resources

00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:50.033
Assisting workers with employment

00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:54.700
I am currently in charge of
warehouse inventory in the company

00:30:55.033 --> 00:30:56.366
When I first joined the company

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.366
Originally, it was the job
of sealing film packaging.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.033
But there was an accident

00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:04.033
My right hand was
covered by the film sealer

00:31:04.366 --> 00:31:06.033
The result was severe burns throughout

00:31:06.366 --> 00:31:08.700
After several times of
skin grafting and stretching

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:11.033
Rehabilitation and Muscle Transplantation

00:31:11.366 --> 00:31:13.366
The recovery situation
will gradually stabilize

00:31:13.366 --> 00:31:16.700
But my right hand is so flat that
it is difficult to hold and grasp it.

00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:20.700
or anything slightly heavier

00:31:21.033 --> 00:31:23.366
I was really anxious

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.700
Because there is no way to
do the original sealing work.

00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:30.366
Fortunately, a manager later referred me to

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.700
Kaohsiung City Government Labor
Bureau Fraternity Skills Training Center

00:31:35.033 --> 00:31:38.700
Finally, he helped me formulate a
career coaching assessment plan

00:31:39.033 --> 00:31:40.033
According to the content of the plan

00:31:40.366 --> 00:31:42.454
It is suggested that I
can consider trying the

00:31:42.466 --> 00:31:44.700
worksheet of the computer
administrative paperwork

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.366
The part about burns
and scald workers' friends

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.504
Usually in the process of
resumption of work, there

00:31:49.516 --> 00:31:51.366
are several important places
that need to be observed

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.033
The first is because the burn
affects the function of sweating

00:31:55.366 --> 00:31:58.366
So can you adapt to the work environment?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.033
The second is limb function and angle, etc.

00:32:02.366 --> 00:32:04.033
Is it possible to start working

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.700
the missing part

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.033
In addition to general
medical rehabilitation

00:32:07.366 --> 00:32:09.366
Is there any kind of aid that can help him

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.700
such as hand grasping aids

00:32:12.033 --> 00:32:16.700
Computer homework can use
trackball, mouse, keypad, etc.

00:32:17.366 --> 00:32:20.033
These are all services that
can be redesigned by job

00:32:20.366 --> 00:32:22.700
To help our labor friends
return to work smoothly

00:32:23.366 --> 00:32:24.366
simply put

00:32:24.366 --> 00:32:25.700
Job redesign services can assist

00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:29.366
Our Occupational Worker
Friends Redesign Workflow

00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:33.033
Working with employers to
redesign work environment

00:32:33.366 --> 00:32:35.033
and provide technical aids, etc.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.366
Find a better way to work

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.700
To provide workers with occupational
disasters in a case-managed manner

00:32:42.033 --> 00:32:43.366
Personalized in-depth service

00:32:44.366 --> 00:32:45.849
Kaohsiung City
Government Labor Bureau

00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:47.700
cooperates with the
Ministry of Labor to promote

00:32:50.033 --> 00:32:51.366
Active Service Program for
Occupational Accident Labor Cases

00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:54.700
And has a single service
window to return to the head office

00:32:55.366 --> 00:32:58.033
Take the initiative to care about and
contact workers in occupational disasters

00:32:59.033 --> 00:33:03.033
For workers who have obtained a disability
certificate due to occupational accident

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.410
can be referred to the
Kaohsiung City Government

00:33:06.422 --> 00:33:08.700
Labor Bureau Boai
Zhuneng Training Center

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.366
Assisted by a central counsellor in
your career coaching assessment

00:33:14.033 --> 00:33:18.033
Vocational training, job
redesign, employment services

00:33:18.366 --> 00:33:21.033
and entrepreneurial counseling
and other related resources

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.366
return to work early

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.033
In fact, the process is
from complaining to anxiety

00:33:29.366 --> 00:33:32.366
Then start to regain your confidence

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.033
And Kaohsiung City Government Labor Bureau

00:33:35.366 --> 00:33:37.033
Talk to the counselors
of the training center

00:33:37.065 --> 00:33:40.457
Helped me a lot in the
process and also assisted me in

00:33:40.469 --> 00:33:43.998
applying for a job and
redesigned the auxiliary equipment

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.033
Allow me to develop smoothly
into computer paperwork

00:33:48.366 --> 00:33:50.700
Finally with the assistance
of employment services

00:33:51.033 --> 00:33:53.366
Found my current company

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.366
I've been in this new
company for two years now

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.700
Engaged in the related work of
warehouse document management

00:34:01.033 --> 00:34:04.700
I also get along very well
with my colleagues here.

00:34:05.033 --> 00:34:07.700
So I want to tell friends who have
the same occupational accident

00:34:08.033 --> 00:34:09.033
do not give up

00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:11.033
Come to the Labour Office for help

00:34:11.366 --> 00:34:13.699
We can go back to work

00:34:14.033 --> 00:34:15.699
restart our life

00:34:16.033 --> 00:34:19.033
We know very well when a worker who has
an accident has to return to the workplace

00:34:19.366 --> 00:34:22.699
The situation and mood
that may be encountered, etc.

00:34:23.033 --> 00:34:25.033
Therefore, in the preparation
process before the resumption of work

00:34:25.366 --> 00:34:28.366
Professional service resources
available for job redesign

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.699
Let's think about it together

00:34:30.033 --> 00:34:31.699
For example, adjusting working methods

00:34:32.033 --> 00:34:34.033
Adjust or simplify work

00:34:34.366 --> 00:34:37.699
Improvements to the workplace
environment, work equipment or machinery

00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:41.033
Or provide customized technical aids, etc.

00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:43.033
There are many ways to help

00:34:43.366 --> 00:34:46.033
Our Occupational Accident
Workers Are Better at Work

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:48.699
Then Taiwan's Occupational
Accident Labor Protection Law

00:34:49.033 --> 00:34:51.699
A portion of the Auxiliary
Facilities Grant is also provided

00:34:52.033 --> 00:34:54.033
There are also resources
related to career services

00:34:54.366 --> 00:34:56.033
can be put to good use

00:34:56.366 --> 00:35:00.033
I believe it can make the process
of returning to work smoother for us

00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:03.994
The resumption of work
by accident workers is an

00:35:04.006 --> 00:35:06.700
important labor policy
currently promoted by Hewan

00:35:07.033 --> 00:35:09.033
Help workers with occupational
disasters to return to work early

00:35:09.366 --> 00:35:11.854
It can effectively
prevent the deterioration

00:35:11.866 --> 00:35:14.033
of the health of the
workers themselves

00:35:14.366 --> 00:35:17.366
But so-called medical
stability is not medical finality

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.033
after the medical acute phase

00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:22.188
A return to work
strategy designed with the

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.033
ability of workers in
occupational disasters

00:35:24.366 --> 00:35:27.033
Can still return to work and be productive

00:35:27.366 --> 00:35:29.366
Body of Workers Accident

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.366
Both psychological and
social functioning are helpful

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.033
But the return-to-work
strategy is an inter-school

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:37.366
Risk assessment for safe return to work

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:42.700
Need to know and understand
about injuries, labor and duties

00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:45.366
To prevent the injury from happening again

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.700
cause recovery failure

00:35:46.802 --> 00:35:49.891
Now, the workers in Taiwan who have
been injured at work have returned to work.

00:35:50.366 --> 00:35:53.366
Preliminary experience and
models for career reconstruction

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.700
This is for the worker friend
of the occupational accident

00:35:56.033 --> 00:35:59.700
This represents a professional
and managerial approach

00:36:00.033 --> 00:36:04.366
Come and help our disaster workers
return to the workplace efficiently

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.366
Friends of non-disabled
workers in occupational accident

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.700
If you have employment collusion needs

00:36:11.033 --> 00:36:13.800
In addition to contacting the
Kaohsiung City Government Labor

00:36:13.812 --> 00:36:16.366
Bureau's single service window
for occupational accidents

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.033
You can also contact the nearest
person to whom the labor bureau belongs.

00:36:20.169 --> 00:36:22.783
Employment service
stations and service desks to

00:36:22.795 --> 00:36:25.528
inquire about relevant
employment service resources
