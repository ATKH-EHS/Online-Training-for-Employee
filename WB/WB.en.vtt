WEBVTT

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:10.752
OK, everyone. Next,
let's go to lesson 3 of today

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.544
And then

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.176
I'm Lydia from wire bond. I'm a production
engineer and environmental safety guard

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:19.968
OK, today is my first class

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.528
Please forgive me

00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:29.640
Basically, I will introduce more about
the industrial safety in our wire bond

00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:32.512
Or what we do

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:35.840
That is, if you know what you think

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:39.985
Not bad, then you can go to your
department to communicate with your

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:44.067
environmental safety and health
department to see if you want to do this

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:52.736
This is what I'm going to talk about today

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:58.036
What is Anwai doing before that

00:00:58.112 --> 00:00:58.880
The first one is

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:03.232
We are life care when you are at work

00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:08.507
You may find some problems or
abnormal health of your colleagues

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:10.656
You can take care of him immediately

00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:14.496
The second is risk management,
which is when our environment

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.800
Some machines, you think

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:20.347
It's a little dangerous or
you often have strange

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.200
sounds and strange
smell inside the machine

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:24.736
We can know in advance

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:26.528
It could be dangerous

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.600
The third is to train communication

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.904
Like we have a class now

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:34.464
That absorbs a lot of different things

00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:36.768
I just had a face

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:39.840
First aid fire or something different

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:42.743
With the sharing of
units, you can strengthen

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:45.472
your concept of
environmental safety and health

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:47.264
The fourth is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.800
Regulations

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:53.080
Will it tell you too much
because it's too complicated

00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:57.248
Maybe a little bit about the
rules that you might actually use

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:02.880
So this is continuous improvement.
This is when we are at work or in life

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:05.184
What we know makes us

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.232
Life can be better

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:10.304
This is going to be our time

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.840
In all the courses

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:13.888
Five aspects that will be included

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:17.984
So the next thing is, this is
the whole engineering process

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.982
I belong to the part
of wire bond, so I will

00:02:21.994 --> 00:02:24.913
introduce the part of
wire bond to you today

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:26.176
Because maybe a lot of people

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.736
It's not clear what wire bond is doing

00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:32.608
This is the introduction
of our machine. Our pre

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.118
process is die bond, so we
will have different products

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:41.024
There may be different machines.
We'll have a plasma blower

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.608
Wire bonder CC dispenser oven

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:46.768
CCD and AOI self test

00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:49.728
After that, the manufacturing
process will be our molding

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:57.664
Each of your standard
am units will be introduced

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.760
What is am standard? It means that we can

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:06.093
We will set up a standard
model for each model

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:09.440
This model will be pasted on
it. This is the standard model

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:13.536
All the labels we should have
on it, we have to put it on it

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.584
Note that it may be in

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.848
Some machines will be heated,
so you should be careful not to scald

00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:23.672
Or when you put the product
on it, he will have the risk

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:27.104
of being pinched, or he
will be caught and rolled up

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.920
Then we'll put some labels on you

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.456
I know very well

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.550
What's the risk of this machine

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.600
But usually new machines come in

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:42.386
Maybe the manufacturer is better and
will help you paste some English labels

00:03:42.464 --> 00:03:45.442
Sometimes we don't have to understand

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:47.840
So when you see it in the production line

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:53.216
Or you see some new models
or new things in the office

00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:55.008
The stickers he pasted

00:03:55.264 --> 00:03:56.288
You don't understand

00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:58.080
Or he didn't have a sticker at all

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.796
It's like an emergency button

00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:01.408
He must be red

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:06.528
I didn't post any Chinese
or English words to tell you

00:04:07.552 --> 00:04:11.516
Just remind the engineer who is in charge

00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:15.488
Or the maintenance staff
should remind him to stick it

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:18.864
This action of urgent
sticker let everyone

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:21.882
know that it is risky to
say where he operates

00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:27.519
In terms of environmental considerations
and hazard assessment, we have one

00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.103
Heinrich proposed a law of 300 291

00:04:31.622 --> 00:04:35.174
I believe many of you
have taken the SGA course

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.223
300 29 1

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.242
He is that every 300
hidden dangers or illegal

00:04:40.254 --> 00:04:44.671
operations, there will be
29 minor injuries or failures

00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:48.511
Usually, we can also rescue these 29

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:54.543
There could be 29 fatal
accidents in the accident

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.447
So we are in the ordinary

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.983
Production line

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:01.835
At present, it is very popular
to push SGA activities, that

00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:05.198
is, when you find something
wrong with the card in your work

00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:08.479
Or is it something you
don't feel right doing

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:11.295
We have to be brave enough to bring it up

00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:13.087
To be one of you

00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:17.567
Maybe you can write it down every
day when you record some work

00:05:19.743 --> 00:05:23.765
This figure is the assessment
of some environmental

00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:27.423
hazards listed in our
wire bond production line

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.495
The word is relatively small

00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:36.468
Usually the orange part becomes a high risk

00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:39.430
The yellow part would be a moderate risk

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:40.735
Basically, we

00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:46.576
At this time, the safety and environmental
protection line should deal with the risk

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:49.898
We'll take the orange part first

00:05:50.207 --> 00:05:56.105
Usually we will list after the
orange section that if today's station

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.911
Like wire bond, there's
something called sandblasting

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:01.115
Sand blasting is dusty

00:06:01.181 --> 00:06:03.830
Dust hazards to people

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.925
If you do it for a long time,
you will have pneumoconiosis,

00:06:06.937 --> 00:06:09.407
or you will cause irreversible
damage to your lungs

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.233
Then we must sandblast
this thing, then we can use

00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:16.831
what kind of way to protect
him, will reduce his damage

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.159
That's probably when
they're doing it, they have to

00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:21.951
Wear N95 mask

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:25.279
Except for the N95 masks, they
may have dust because of that

00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:28.351
So you need to wear an
eye mask to protect their eyes

00:06:28.863 --> 00:06:33.911
They also need to wear earplugs because
of the high decibels during sandblasting

00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.567
He protected him
through our different tools

00:06:37.823 --> 00:06:40.639
He can be protected throughout the process

00:06:40.927 --> 00:06:44.715
So we will focus on the high
risk of the whole production line

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.807
We're going to do something necessary first

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:54.719
Basically, in wire bond,
our goal in 2021 is last year

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:57.023
We used to be here

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.815
The plan is also us

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:02.374
They sorted it out when they passed the SGA

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.098
That's because of the
change of the previous process.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.519
Sometimes the gold wire
turns to the copper wire

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.335
We didn't change the whole process

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:15.737
I may have copper wire products. I
want plasma. I want plasma cleaning

00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:17.636
Slotted boxes must be used

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:19.551
But before, because he
was a gold thread product

00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:23.647
When you don't need to do
plasma cleaning, he uses a solid box

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:26.171
It's that I may change
the process, I only

00:07:26.183 --> 00:07:28.301
change half of it, and
the other part doesn't

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:30.559
So it's very common in wire bond

00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:33.119
I'm from die bond. He's slotting

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:37.446
But when I'm done, I have to
go to molding and it's a solid box

00:07:37.471 --> 00:07:39.007
They're going to become

00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:42.989
When the product is finished,
the box changes all the time

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:48.479
In the process of conversion, they
have to leave and then move back

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:52.534
For the production line,
it's also a waste of cost, and

00:07:52.546 --> 00:07:56.356
for people's troubles, they've
been walking all the time

00:07:56.927 --> 00:08:02.815
They are after the whole
evaluation, after we collect the data

00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:04.095
We feel that

00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:07.167
Then I can try our post process

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:08.703
If we

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:11.626
Are slotted boxes used to the
back section of the impact on them

00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:15.012
Let's have a discussion
with the post process

00:08:16.127 --> 00:08:19.711
Well, we've been working on the improvement
plan before, and we'll look for it first

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:23.289
We discuss with the
engineers in our own production

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:26.442
line, and then discuss
with the following molding

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:29.864
Then, because of the influence
of the box, you must also

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.767
confirm with the person who
receives the order from APC

00:08:33.023 --> 00:08:35.839
Is that enough for me

00:08:36.095 --> 00:08:37.375
Are these boxes enough

00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:38.911
Then if I

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:40.959
After the replacement, my possibility

00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:44.031
There are more boxes. Is
my nitrogen tank enough

00:08:44.543 --> 00:08:47.547
When everything is OK, we
can ask the production line

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.687
to help us run a batch to
the later stage to do the test

00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:56.063
After that, our engineers can
change the program of this product

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:58.111
And let him become me

00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:01.214
Dire bond to molding I
don't need to change the box

00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:06.559
In fact, some OP can reduce the risk

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:12.191
So this is where we were last
year, because now it's the end

00:09:12.703 --> 00:09:16.031
It's still running cab
process, so it's not finished yet

00:09:16.287 --> 00:09:19.615
However, if this matter is completed

00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:21.919
Second sister, they are doing things

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:25.578
In fact, it can save two hours

00:09:27.008 --> 00:09:31.391
In fact, sometimes when we
do SGA again, we will feel that

00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:34.463
The production line is very busy because
it really needs to take care of the machine

00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:38.559
Then I felt that it was very
tiring to participate in SGA

00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:42.213
However, when the real results
come out and really reduce

00:09:42.225 --> 00:09:45.215
their own burden, you will
find that in fact this thing

00:09:45.727 --> 00:09:47.706
It's not as difficult as you think

00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:49.544
So it is

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.542
As a production line,
one of the most important

00:09:52.554 --> 00:09:55.455
activities is to focus on
the production line chain

00:09:55.677 --> 00:09:59.005
Make some improvements
to the frequency of risks

00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:04.415
The SGA of improvement
activities is also in

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:06.463
Production line people, they will

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:07.999
Like I said we were

00:10:08.255 --> 00:10:11.327
I usually list some in my work

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:14.655
I think Kaka's party will write it down

00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:20.099
I'll list them all, when the next
issue of SGA is going to do it again

00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:23.103
We can pick out some problems from it

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:28.223
In frequency, in possible
human trouble, on SQD CP

00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:31.551
We feel that we have made
the highest improvement

00:10:32.575 --> 00:10:36.255
Now here is another SGA
activity. The project they have

00:10:36.267 --> 00:10:40.288
improved is what they want.
They want to reduce the foam time

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:42.047
There's a process in wire bond

00:10:42.303 --> 00:10:44.706
It's called CC dispensing

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:49.483
This is after our wire bond has been wired,
because the wire is actually very fragile

00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:51.583
The thread is thinner than our hair

00:10:52.031 --> 00:10:52.799
So sometimes

00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:54.335
We may be a little bit

00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:58.943
Move a line of arc will
collapse, the risk of collapse is

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:03.039
When our products reach
customers, this one may become

00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:04.319
It's short

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.062
He can't function properly

00:11:07.457 --> 00:11:12.129
So we're doing it.
They're dealing with foam

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.791
The trouble with OP

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:16.998
We need foam, and we
need to put it back on again.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.683
When do I need it and
when do I change corners

00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:24.799
At that time, our current situation
analysis was divided into three points

00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:28.403
The first one is that I
spend time making glue

00:11:28.512 --> 00:11:30.240
It took 18 minutes at a time

00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:32.738
About ten times a day

00:11:32.763 --> 00:11:36.761
It takes 180 minutes to
soak and walk back and forth

00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:42.463
The second is us, because we have three
kinds of ABC glue to mix, then our c glue

00:11:42.975 --> 00:11:46.303
His liquid state is like water

00:11:46.328 --> 00:11:48.602
It will flow quickly

00:11:49.119 --> 00:11:51.629
The third is when glue
a needs to be used up

00:11:51.654 --> 00:11:52.678
Because usually

00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:56.323
I don't know if you have eaten maltose

00:11:56.543 --> 00:11:58.847
When we finish the maltose, but it is

00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:02.489
There will be some residue
on the wall of the cup, but if you

00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:06.119
don't want to waste time, you
will pour that glue into the new one

00:12:06.527 --> 00:12:07.551
Want to collect more

00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:12.927
Then we are fishbone diagram
to confirm the true cause

00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:14.975
In fact, we take it in foam

00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:17.583
Material moving back and
forth, some people through

00:12:17.595 --> 00:12:20.095
the deletion, merger,
reorganization and simplification

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:23.935
And then it was in all the SGA steps

00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:26.193
They have 29 steps

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:28.775
And then because of
the merger, reorganization

00:12:28.787 --> 00:12:30.591
and simplification,
we lost six steps

00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:33.407
So it's 23 steps

00:12:33.663 --> 00:12:36.223
The second part of C
glue is not easy to pour

00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:38.527
We also want to say that we found some

00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:43.135
Assistive tools, such as a beaker and
a dropper, will stir a stick to assist him

00:12:43.903 --> 00:12:47.178
The third problem is that it's
not easy to collect the remaining

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.972
glue, that is, we open a
new bottle of glue a to use up

00:12:50.815 --> 00:12:55.679
Basically, the way we do it is by putting
two bottles together and letting it flow

00:12:56.447 --> 00:12:59.166
But because of this, sometimes
if I accidentally bump into him,

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:01.823
maybe the first bottle is broken,
and he falls down and breaks

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:03.871
The second one is that it can cause

00:13:04.127 --> 00:13:06.431
The glue on the top
of the wall is left outside

00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:11.075
We're going to take the
material back and forth,

00:13:11.087 --> 00:13:13.343
and we're going to take
the glue back and forth

00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:15.391
We're really going to walk around

00:13:15.647 --> 00:13:19.127
Then we simplify six
steps, and when we have

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:22.398
23 steps left, we
actually cut 183 seconds

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:25.173
I'll tell you, because of
course I run ten times a day

00:13:25.198 --> 00:13:28.422
We lost 1800 seconds

00:13:28.703 --> 00:13:31.507
The second one is when
we do the experiment

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.335
with the beaker, the
dropper and the stirrer

00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:38.687
When the beaker and the dropper
are being made, because it's actually

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:42.208
It's a little thick, so
if you pour it into a

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.094
small beaker or into a
dropper, then pour it out

00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:46.399
Actually, the same wall

00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:48.656
The residual glue wastes more

00:13:48.927 --> 00:13:53.535
And the third one, we'll use the stirrer
to let him flow slowly along the mixing rod

00:13:54.047 --> 00:13:55.583
So this part is actually us

00:13:55.912 --> 00:13:58.713
After watching, the effect is
the best, he will not have any

00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:01.446
drops of glue, and then the
residual glue will be the least

00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:02.495
The third is the third

00:14:02.751 --> 00:14:06.810
We also use the bottle mouth to
bottle way to collect residual glue

00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:09.356
As I said just now,
the risk that he may

00:14:09.368 --> 00:14:12.086
fall or leak out is
actually quite dangerous

00:14:12.223 --> 00:14:13.503
So in the end we

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:17.318
Ask the engineer to help us
design an empty bottle bracket

00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:19.391
In terms of security or

00:14:19.647 --> 00:14:22.990
Or in terms of collection,
the effect is quite good

00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:27.895
Just said that cup of glue is
like a silver one on the picture

00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:33.215
In fact, when we put it in, we hit
it again or accidentally moved to it

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:36.788
It doesn't have any risks

00:14:37.055 --> 00:14:40.170
That's because the whole thing is

00:14:40.383 --> 00:14:44.223
We've reduced a lot of time in
the whole glue making process

00:14:44.479 --> 00:14:48.031
That is, for the production
line, I can also do other

00:14:48.043 --> 00:14:51.937
things at the same time when
I have finished putting things

00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:57.791
Next, I'm going to talk about
wire bond accident correction

00:15:00.607 --> 00:15:10.031
In wire bond work, it is less likely to
encounter chemical plating or chemicals

00:15:10.847 --> 00:15:18.208
In the wire bond accident, it often occurs
in personnel transportation or walking

00:15:18.271 --> 00:15:22.111
Or the machine is in
the process of touching

00:15:24.671 --> 00:15:29.558
The picture above is
plasma machine cleaning

00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:32.696
Plasma cleaning actually
has two rings above the door

00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:34.143
When the door closes

00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:35.470
You can see it from the outside

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:39.143
It has a slide to see the
cleaning condition inside it

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:43.615
In fact, we didn't find the two circles

00:15:43.871 --> 00:15:45.151
His chamfering is

00:15:45.407 --> 00:15:46.175
Very sharp

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:48.735
This is because, in fact, if we normally

00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:49.759
Open the door slowly

00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:52.373
There's nothing to touch that

00:15:52.831 --> 00:15:55.903
But that day was because
of the door of our machine

00:15:56.671 --> 00:15:59.231
It may be because of
the uneven production line

00:15:59.487 --> 00:16:01.023
Sometimes the machine is too
heavy, resulting in uneven ground

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:02.559
When the floor is uneven

00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:03.839
You open the door

00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:07.432
OP to move products

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:09.471
The door rebounds when you come back

00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:14.548
In fact, OP is very nervous because
the product he is about to report may hit

00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:16.639
He put his hand over the door

00:16:17.407 --> 00:16:19.699
As a result, when he
was just in the middle of

00:16:19.711 --> 00:16:22.113
the line, his hand was
drawn from the round place

00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:27.267
This led to two or three
stitches in his hands

00:16:27.647 --> 00:16:28.927
Because his hands are direct

00:16:29.183 --> 00:16:31.064
He's wearing these silicone gloves

00:16:31.487 --> 00:16:33.279
Speed down with that power

00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:35.583
He hurt his hand

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:42.838
So we basically took
the corrective action, and

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.823
then we all regulated
the personnel of plasma

00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:48.639
The max-see gloves must be thicker

00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:52.223
It's not so direct that he touches it

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:56.278
Then the door of plasma will be chamfered

00:16:56.319 --> 00:16:57.855
This is what we will really be

00:16:58.367 --> 00:17:01.439
The place that feels
sharper is to go out and do it

00:17:01.695 --> 00:17:06.056
The chamfering of 1 mm can prevent the
personnel from touching it again next time

00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:07.839
It will have rebound problems

00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:16.031
There are two most common accidents
in wire bond. The first is falling

00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:18.591
The second is the
accident outside the factory

00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:21.151
I'll talk about this later

00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:25.247
This one

00:17:27.295 --> 00:17:29.343
I don't know if I can see this clearly

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:32.135
It's our sightseeing aisle
on the first floor of C5

00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:36.968
Well, I remember that the air return
port is protruding. It seems that only

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.119
the front section and the back section
of the C51 floor are near the door

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:45.754
Basically, the other floors
are made of that blue cloth

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:47.475
It will not protrude

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.823
Because this one is us

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:51.871
stay

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:55.429
When the staff are ready
to leave work, they are

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:58.015
sometimes good friends
and they are in groups

00:17:58.271 --> 00:17:58.783
Work together

00:17:59.295 --> 00:18:02.111
The result is in the picture on the left

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:03.391
Which one

00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:09.074
Miss, when he was walking, he
suddenly tripped over the air return

00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:12.661
He's on the top right of the floor

00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:16.422
Before this happened

00:18:16.447 --> 00:18:17.983
None of us really will go

00:18:18.102 --> 00:18:20.836
How protruding is it

00:18:21.311 --> 00:18:23.615
And then we just

00:18:24.127 --> 00:18:29.503
After discussing with both the
factory and our own SAE, we found that

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:31.039
We do

00:18:32.063 --> 00:18:36.583
A lot of them bounce themselves, and
we can't press them back with our hands

00:18:36.927 --> 00:18:41.045
I don't know what's going on.
He's going to pop himself out

00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:43.327
With us, too

00:18:44.095 --> 00:18:47.167
The people from the factory
should communicate with each other

00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:49.215
Can you help us

00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:54.335
You can adjust the air return again

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.639
So he helped us with our screws

00:18:56.895 --> 00:19:00.738
Replace all the fixed knobs

00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:04.271
So basically, our return air outlet is now

00:19:04.305 --> 00:19:07.581
It will open, but it will
be fixed in that window,

00:19:07.593 --> 00:19:10.365
even if people are
walking against the wall

00:19:10.463 --> 00:19:13.023
It won't cause injury

00:19:15.327 --> 00:19:17.631
I'll show you the next
one. It might be clearer

00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:21.192
The place of the red line
under the air return port is

00:19:21.204 --> 00:19:24.598
convex outside, so the personnel
will pick it up when they go

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:27.871
Now the Yellow knob holds it in place

00:19:28.383 --> 00:19:32.991
Basically, the lower blade doesn't protrude

00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:36.575
That's how we define him

00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:40.848
Then we also ask SAE to go
out for inspection at a fixed time

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:42.463
Is there a problem with it

00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:49.722
The next one is what I just
said about wire bond. The

00:19:49.734 --> 00:19:52.447
most common accidents are
accidents outside the factory

00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:59.412
It's all this year that you
don't have the last date

00:20:01.407 --> 00:20:04.915
I don't know why this year.
Since the beginning of the

00:20:04.927 --> 00:20:08.319
year, there have been
people cycling in the wire bond

00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:12.927
Maybe I fell down, or
the car in front of me

00:20:13.183 --> 00:20:14.207
Turn left and right suddenly

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:15.487
He didn't turn on the lights

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.610
He started hitting the lights

00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:20.607
There is also a period of urgency

00:20:20.863 --> 00:20:21.887
There is another one

00:20:23.167 --> 00:20:27.955
On August 1st, the typhoon
came to work by bike

00:20:28.543 --> 00:20:30.599
And I just rode through a puddle

00:20:30.847 --> 00:20:35.415
But because there was no hole
in the water, he fell and fell out

00:20:35.967 --> 00:20:39.364
So in fact, it is very
difficult to tell people how

00:20:39.376 --> 00:20:42.784
to be careful about the
accident outside the factory

00:20:42.879 --> 00:20:45.033
But I can only ride slowly

00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:50.279
What should we do in case of
an accident outside the factory

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.399
The first one is that you
are on your way to work

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:57.471
When you are in a traffic
accident, you must first ask for help

00:20:57.983 --> 00:20:58.751
Then when you

00:20:59.263 --> 00:21:02.562
We will depend on the
severity of our injuries

00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.563
The first way you can
do something is to find

00:21:05.575 --> 00:21:08.494
a passer-by if you
really don't have any help

00:21:08.762 --> 00:21:10.351
And

00:21:10.593 --> 00:21:13.481
When you're not that serious
and you're slightly injured

00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:14.623
You can call yourself

00:21:15.135 --> 00:21:19.451
Go to the police and say that you
have a car accident or you fell down

00:21:19.476 --> 00:21:21.875
Many people in the
factory have a myth that

00:21:21.887 --> 00:21:24.352
I should not call the
police when I fall down

00:21:24.608 --> 00:21:28.448
Because he fell down and
then he had to call the police

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.056
But it's not something you
have to do, even if you fall out

00:21:33.312 --> 00:21:35.574
You must call the police to get it

00:21:35.616 --> 00:21:38.688
It's not a joint report

00:21:38.944 --> 00:21:42.066
Prove that you really had an accident here

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:46.901
Be sure to go to the West
Hospital for consultation

00:21:47.392 --> 00:21:50.912
I can't say that you just
hit your foot and twisted it.

00:21:50.924 --> 00:21:54.329
Then I'll go to the hospital
and apply ointment to him

00:21:55.072 --> 00:21:58.524
The company's work-related
injury regulations are

00:21:58.536 --> 00:22:01.722
not allowed to apply
for work-related injuries

00:22:01.984 --> 00:22:04.684
So it's very important to prepare
what kind of information you

00:22:04.696 --> 00:22:07.279
should give to the environmental
safety guard of your family

00:22:07.306 --> 00:22:08.896
The first is the report of the triple

00:22:09.216 --> 00:22:10.663
Or when you fall

00:22:10.688 --> 00:22:12.561
He'll give you a certificate

00:22:12.586 --> 00:22:16.066
Prove at which intersection
you had an accident

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.624
The second is the hospital's diagnosis

00:22:19.136 --> 00:22:21.499
The diagnosis proved
that it was basically OK

00:22:21.696 --> 00:22:23.488
I suggest you apply
for two copies at a time

00:22:23.744 --> 00:22:24.768
Because of one

00:22:25.024 --> 00:22:28.839
Send it to the factory nurse for
your work-related injury application

00:22:28.864 --> 00:22:30.912
The second is because
the company has insurance

00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:35.809
Then you can use this to do
your insurance application again

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:39.397
The third is the front and
back of a driver's license

00:22:39.616 --> 00:22:44.736
Usually, people like my family often
give me the positive and not the negative

00:22:45.248 --> 00:22:46.236
Why should we give
the negative side when

00:22:46.248 --> 00:22:47.296
there is no information
on the opposite side

00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:49.509
But in fact, there is
a license number in

00:22:49.521 --> 00:22:51.879
the upper left corner
of the driver's license

00:22:51.904 --> 00:22:54.720
So the back must also
be given to sanitation

00:22:54.976 --> 00:22:58.535
If it's the fourth fall, it's self fall

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.608
You must pay for the motorcycle

00:23:00.864 --> 00:23:03.936
Front and rear tire photos to sanitation

00:23:04.192 --> 00:23:08.032
Make sure you don't
skate because of the old tire

00:23:09.312 --> 00:23:12.640
Because it's not a work-related
injury on the way to work

00:23:13.664 --> 00:23:15.712
Then send it out and it will pass

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.227
They're going to assess
that you've fallen down

00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:22.112
and maybe your own
motorcycle hasn't been serviced

00:23:22.624 --> 00:23:25.440
Maybe the tire of your motorcycle is flat

00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.975
It doesn't have a skid stop effect

00:23:28.379 --> 00:23:30.046
I didn't change the tire

00:23:30.448 --> 00:23:32.248
So this is actually

00:23:32.352 --> 00:23:33.888
The company delivered it for us

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.448
Go to the labor bureau

00:23:36.704 --> 00:23:38.240
Check it when you go

00:23:38.496 --> 00:23:41.056
He'll take that as a judgment

00:23:41.568 --> 00:23:48.519
So, in fact, we have to go to the car and
locomotive. Are the tire lines deep enough

00:23:49.248 --> 00:23:51.808
The fifth is your commute map

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.648
Of course, there was an
accident on the way to work

00:23:56.928 --> 00:24:01.472
The roadmap is to use Google
map to draw the route to him

00:24:01.792 --> 00:24:04.750
Maybe some people will go to
and from work because of the

00:24:04.762 --> 00:24:07.936
problem of picking up and
seeing off the children or something

00:24:08.192 --> 00:24:11.520
Of course, if you go out to
eat with friends, you don't know

00:24:12.288 --> 00:24:14.592
If you have to, you must carry the children

00:24:14.848 --> 00:24:18.240
What kind of proof do you have

00:24:18.265 --> 00:24:20.199
The Labor Bureau will also make judgments

00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:25.211
Then the final seal is the seal, because to
prove that this document is written by you

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.716
Therefore, what kind of
information should be prepared for

00:24:27.728 --> 00:24:29.747
environmental safety and
health is a more important part

00:24:32.256 --> 00:24:37.376
The next step is the emergency armband. I
believe everyone should have passed it on

00:24:38.656 --> 00:24:40.939
The company's emergency response
team is divided into five groups,

00:24:40.951 --> 00:24:43.520
including refuge Guidance Group,
notification group and fire fighting group

00:24:44.098 --> 00:24:46.103
Ambulance and security

00:24:46.336 --> 00:24:48.384
Basically, part of the wire bond is because

00:24:48.773 --> 00:24:50.349
In fact, sometimes
there are too many

00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:52.326
informers, and then the
armband is on the right

00:24:52.351 --> 00:24:55.015
So if you see people from the left

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.311
I don't know what the group is

00:24:57.344 --> 00:24:59.879
So we'll make a picture

00:24:59.904 --> 00:25:03.488
Then list the people in each group below

00:25:03.513 --> 00:25:06.042
And post it on the column

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:08.333
Or when you pass on the
signature, you can read it first

00:25:08.964 --> 00:25:13.060
I have an impression of who I'm
looking for when what happened to me

00:25:13.728 --> 00:25:15.008
A lot of times we

00:25:15.776 --> 00:25:18.374
Like before, some auditors
went into the production

00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:20.896
line, and he would randomly
select a person to ask

00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:23.200
Who are you looking for
when you are injured today

00:25:23.712 --> 00:25:26.016
In fact, most people began to answer
the question of looking for the foreman

00:25:26.784 --> 00:25:28.948
In fact, this is no problem
for the young lady. They think

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.136
that if there is a problem,
it is right to find the foreman

00:25:31.904 --> 00:25:33.184
But for auditors

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.488
You have five branches

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.579
So when you get hurt, you
should call your ambulance team

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.317
So it's important for you to remember
that there are five groups in the company

00:25:43.354 --> 00:25:46.520
What is he doing in each group

00:25:46.752 --> 00:25:52.384
When there is an audit,
at least you should tell him

00:25:52.896 --> 00:25:53.920
Find someone with a badge

00:25:54.176 --> 00:25:57.349
If you really can't
answer his name, you say

00:25:57.361 --> 00:26:00.263
that people with
armbands will still pass

00:26:02.368 --> 00:26:06.976
The next step is the epidemic
prevention work in recent years

00:26:07.538 --> 00:26:12.352
We should feel it

00:26:12.608 --> 00:26:15.191
Basically, because
of the new year's Eve,

00:26:15.203 --> 00:26:17.984
the company started
to do a series of surveys

00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:26.240
This information was made
by me the year before last

00:26:26.432 --> 00:26:30.016
At that time, I told you when I came
back from the Chinese New Year

00:26:30.272 --> 00:26:32.551
When your family and friends come back

00:26:32.576 --> 00:26:34.880
What should be confirmed

00:26:35.404 --> 00:26:39.005
Until now, it's still the
same way, just before you

00:26:39.017 --> 00:26:42.353
know your family and
friends are going back home

00:26:42.378 --> 00:26:44.352
You need to contact him first

00:26:44.608 --> 00:26:47.936
What are you doing? When are
you flying? And where are you going

00:26:48.448 --> 00:26:49.984
14 day quarantine

00:26:51.264 --> 00:26:54.848
You want to make sure I'll
see him when he comes back

00:26:55.104 --> 00:27:00.224
That's until he's back here
and quarantined for 14 days

00:27:00.981 --> 00:27:04.727
All departments should be
informed of environmental

00:27:04.739 --> 00:27:08.063
safety and health to make
clear some knowledge

00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:10.573
This is not about prying into your privacy

00:27:10.598 --> 00:27:13.999
Why do you want to tell me

00:27:14.304 --> 00:27:16.421
This is because we want
to protect everyone's safety

00:27:16.608 --> 00:27:21.190
What's different this year is
the last 14 day isolation section

00:27:21.472 --> 00:27:25.190
This year, because of the
government's regulations,

00:27:25.202 --> 00:27:28.286
there are 10 plus 4,
14 natural or 7 plus 7

00:27:28.352 --> 00:27:32.556
In fact, if a friend comes back
from abroad, he or she will have

00:27:32.568 --> 00:27:36.784
a quarantine order, which clearly
indicates which plan he chooses

00:27:36.809 --> 00:27:39.392
So basically, if there's
one, you'll do the same

00:27:39.648 --> 00:27:40.844
We need to give back
to the environmental

00:27:40.856 --> 00:27:42.208
safety and Health
Department of your department

00:27:42.464 --> 00:27:44.000
Let us know that you may

00:27:44.186 --> 00:27:46.560
When are your family,
your relatives and friends

00:27:49.632 --> 00:27:51.731
Isolation or hotel isolation

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:56.288
Basically, if we want to meet friends
and relatives, we recommend him

00:27:56.832 --> 00:27:59.904
After 14 days plus 7
days of self-management

00:28:00.128 --> 00:28:03.431
Then I'll go to the test
and I'll see you later

00:28:03.489 --> 00:28:08.064
It's safer to meet relatives
and friends in 21 days

00:28:11.136 --> 00:28:16.512
1K before the part of epidemic
prevention work company

00:28:16.768 --> 00:28:18.816
We have to wear another layer outside

00:28:19.328 --> 00:28:20.352
Dust free mask

00:28:20.864 --> 00:28:25.460
Now, it's really too hot
for us to bring many layers

00:28:25.484 --> 00:28:31.872
So basically, we can only wear
medical masks for 1K clothes

00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:39.396
In 10K clothes, you also have to
wear medical masks and dust masks

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.045
In this part, it's true that
our wire bond colleagues

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:48.579
are there, that is, we will
target our different groups

00:28:48.604 --> 00:28:50.560
Because we need to separate the warehouse

00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:55.201
Let's talk to one of your colleagues

00:28:56.192 --> 00:29:00.082
Because there are two
doors on the first floor of QFP

00:29:00.866 --> 00:29:02.565
Maybe which group is
going through which door

00:29:02.592 --> 00:29:05.664
It will be easier for us to master

00:29:05.929 --> 00:29:07.200
Which door do they go to

00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:12.576
If he does have a cold, or the
family he meets may have a cold

00:29:12.865 --> 00:29:14.422
Then we can have it first

00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:21.792
The cleaning aunt helped us
clean these places with alcohol

00:29:22.816 --> 00:29:24.608
And then in wire bond, actually

00:29:24.864 --> 00:29:25.632
We are here

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.704
That is, we encourage
our colleagues to vaccinate

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.240
Which day are you going to fight

00:29:30.496 --> 00:29:33.713
Basically, we're all OK. So
you tell the foreman that we

00:29:33.725 --> 00:29:36.785
don't usually block you.
You say you can't fight today

00:29:37.152 --> 00:29:39.456
We have a mechanism

00:29:39.968 --> 00:29:43.552
Just after my colleagues have finished
typing, they will return their yellow cards

00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:46.877
Basically, I would go
and collect their body

00:29:46.889 --> 00:29:49.696
temperature two days
before they finished

00:29:50.208 --> 00:29:55.076
That's basically to make sure they don't
enter the company when they're feverish

00:29:55.101 --> 00:29:58.478
Because some people
feel that although I have

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.510
a fever, I don't feel
too much discomfort

00:30:01.534 --> 00:30:04.288
I can still come to work,
but it's basically for my family

00:30:04.313 --> 00:30:07.631
We don't want it. When you
have a fever, don't enter the factory

00:30:07.881 --> 00:30:11.712
So basically we control their
temperature and their health

00:30:11.968 --> 00:30:14.745
Basically, it's also
indirect, that is to say,

00:30:14.757 --> 00:30:17.487
is your physical condition
OK after the fight?

00:30:17.512 --> 00:30:20.416
Some care for employees

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.792
A while ago may, that was
May of the year before last

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.920
When the epidemic broke out,
Kaohsiung had a lot of footprints

00:30:31.168 --> 00:30:33.472
In fact, if you are not careful,
colleagues will step on it

00:30:33.984 --> 00:30:38.052
So every day, as soon as the
footprints come out, we will publish a

00:30:38.064 --> 00:30:42.144
list to ask colleagues whether you
have stepped on these footprints?

00:30:42.432 --> 00:30:45.796
It's not like you don't come
to work when you take these

00:30:45.808 --> 00:30:49.303
footprints, but we may pay
special attention to your health

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.440
Maybe you've had a cold
recently, and we'll let you know

00:30:53.758 --> 00:30:55.333
Then you must go to see a doctor

00:30:55.358 --> 00:30:59.072
Maybe make a quick screen

00:30:59.328 --> 00:31:00.864
To exclude whether you are

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.809
Do you meet this person
and then run into risks

00:31:05.984 --> 00:31:08.852
Next is our escape route from the factory

00:31:08.876 --> 00:31:14.176
Because our wire bond had 6
floors, 7 floors, 8 floors and 1 floors

00:31:14.764 --> 00:31:16.499
Because of the recent relationship

00:31:16.572 --> 00:31:19.552
This is our first floor picture, basically

00:31:19.808 --> 00:31:22.898
We will take the supervisor
of the production line

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.952
and we will go through
all the entrances and exits

00:31:25.979 --> 00:31:29.536
Tell them which way to get to the entrance

00:31:29.792 --> 00:31:30.816
Sometimes

00:31:31.072 --> 00:31:32.864
We can't control the fire

00:31:33.376 --> 00:31:35.168
Then we'll go everywhere

00:31:35.424 --> 00:31:38.541
Go to the door, tap the door
and tell them how to get there

00:31:39.008 --> 00:31:41.312
So this was our sixth floor map

00:31:41.568 --> 00:31:46.261
Because they're going to do it
again in the middle of the building

00:31:46.944 --> 00:31:49.248
That part of the second
floor is already there

00:31:49.278 --> 00:31:52.576
But I haven't led the foreman through yet

00:31:53.088 --> 00:31:57.297
This time, it's because we have to do
an escape drill on February 17 and 18

00:31:57.696 --> 00:32:01.280
Before that, we'll walk again to see what
they're going to do on the second floor

00:32:01.792 --> 00:32:04.096
This is probably our wire bond

00:32:04.352 --> 00:32:07.377
It's a picture of the whole escape drill

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:15.616
What's more, the whole testing process
of our colleagues in the first aid group

00:32:17.664 --> 00:32:19.456
Some colleagues because

00:32:19.712 --> 00:32:22.272
Not on the day of the escape drill

00:32:22.784 --> 00:32:25.359
Get involved in it, then
we'll take our colleagues

00:32:25.371 --> 00:32:28.160
with us directly, which door
do you want to go out from

00:32:28.672 --> 00:32:32.512
But of course, it doesn't say which
door to go out from and go out again

00:32:32.623 --> 00:32:35.190
We'll tell him to get out of this door

00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:37.888
Where will you meet at the last place

00:32:38.144 --> 00:32:40.719
We all take pictures and
then send them back to

00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:43.264
the factory guard to say
that we have done this

00:32:45.312 --> 00:32:47.592
Next is our chemicals management

00:32:47.617 --> 00:32:49.748
In fact, the wire bond
is relatively simple.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.712
In fact, we don't have
too many chemicals

00:32:51.968 --> 00:32:52.992
As I said just now, we
have a dispensing station

00:32:53.248 --> 00:32:58.502
And ABC glue, so we will have
some SDS of glue a, glue B and glue C

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.641
What should you do when you
may touch or touch your eyes

00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:08.084
So this is ABC glue. When
we mix the glue, we will do it

00:33:08.096 --> 00:33:11.168
in the exhaust cabinet, so
they are in the mixing process

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.076
In fact, it will not be infected
by some respiratory tract

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.664
Maybe we will focus on sandblasting

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.390
Yes, some of them
do X-ray, and they do

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:27.133
some special physical
examination every year

00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:30.880
The audit and improvement of 5S is

00:33:31.136 --> 00:33:34.208
This is the part that belongs to
environmental safety and health

00:33:35.488 --> 00:33:39.729
Because of the recent relocation, many
departments should have such a situation

00:33:39.754 --> 00:33:41.632
Actually, they're going to
have a fire hydrant up there

00:33:42.144 --> 00:33:46.520
But sometimes the tricolor lights
are higher or the pillars are higher

00:33:46.544 --> 00:33:49.353
We don't notice that we hit
the fire fighting equipment

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:55.200
So in fact, this is also a need to pay
attention to when you move the plane

00:33:55.502 --> 00:33:59.337
Because in fact, if the red color is
moved to, it may start to spray water

00:33:59.808 --> 00:34:02.880
Because their sensors are very sensitive

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.256
The next is some of our wire bond kanban

00:34:08.512 --> 00:34:11.189
How can we preach things to our colleagues

00:34:11.584 --> 00:34:13.376
That's our production line

00:34:13.632 --> 00:34:14.400
And then

00:34:14.656 --> 00:34:18.004
The second is that wire bond
has our own bulletin board

00:34:18.062 --> 00:34:21.073
It's line @ sometimes when
you go to a restaurant, maybe

00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:24.161
he will force you to join line
@ with discounts or coupons

00:34:24.668 --> 00:34:27.968
In fact, our wire bond has
a bulletin board of our own

00:34:28.224 --> 00:34:30.640
And then for the office
for the production line

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.960
Then we will have something
from time to time, such

00:34:32.972 --> 00:34:35.289
as what is announced by
the environmental safety guard

00:34:35.314 --> 00:34:42.816
Or what needs to be announced by wire bond?
I will send a message to you through line

00:34:44.352 --> 00:34:47.936
Some people, he may be at work, he has some

00:34:48.448 --> 00:34:52.288
It's not easy for him to
reply through this place

00:34:52.544 --> 00:34:56.128
In fact, only managers
can see these contents

00:34:56.384 --> 00:35:02.503
In fact, we have recovered many
problems that we can improve

00:35:02.528 --> 00:35:05.070
So I think it's a good platform

00:35:06.112 --> 00:35:09.095
Finally, we publicize our
code of practice, environmental

00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:12.256
safety and health related
content will be sent to the foreman

00:35:12.512 --> 00:35:14.304
Please help the foreman to report and sign

00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:17.254
This is our maintenance process

00:35:17.632 --> 00:35:23.249
That is, we will basically consider
the health of our colleagues

00:35:23.274 --> 00:35:27.104
There are also human factors engineering
parts that can be added to the best

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.536
That's like the sandblasting
process I just mentioned. They have

00:35:30.548 --> 00:35:33.735
to wear N95 masks, earplugs and
goggles every time they sandblast

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.738
To protect their physical condition

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.416
Electrical lock out and tag
out of the repair organization

00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:44.256
That is, when they stop the aircraft, we
will paste this machine for maintenance

00:35:44.512 --> 00:35:47.889
Don't go to the machine again

00:35:48.352 --> 00:35:56.221
People with x-ray just wear
armbands and do some dose tests

00:35:56.245 --> 00:36:01.741
That's us in the bottom left corner.
He'll pay us a check list every month

00:36:01.775 --> 00:36:04.231
If your dosage armband
exceeds the standard,

00:36:04.243 --> 00:36:06.272
then you are in
good health. Is it OK

00:36:07.808 --> 00:36:09.953
The last concern for employees
is that the company will

00:36:09.965 --> 00:36:12.160
have questions from occupational
doctors, as you all know

00:36:12.416 --> 00:36:14.720
Then the physical condition was assessed

00:36:14.976 --> 00:36:17.268
In wire bond, we also
have chicken soup for soul

00:36:17.292 --> 00:36:19.328
It's when we meet some

00:36:19.873 --> 00:36:23.446
It seems that the face of
this person is not very good

00:36:23.458 --> 00:36:26.783
at work today, or why he
has been abnormal recently

00:36:26.808 --> 00:36:30.823
Actually, these people
will talk to each other slowly

00:36:30.848 --> 00:36:34.186
Then care about the physical
and mental state of employees

00:36:35.456 --> 00:36:37.760
Thank you very much
