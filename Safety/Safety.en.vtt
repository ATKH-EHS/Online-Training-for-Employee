WEBVTT

00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.280
Hello everyone

00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:03.584
good afternoon

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:06.144
Did you get enough sleep?

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:08.192
not yet?

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:10.752
Go out if you can't get enough sleep

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:16.128
wash your face and come back

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:19.712
Because each of our lecturers
has prepared wonderfully

00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:24.832
That environmental protection class
can't talk to everyone within an hour.

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:26.880
Say it in detail, right?

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.060
Because there's a lot of content

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:32.000
I believe that everyone will see
environmental protection in the future

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:33.280
news

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:36.352
It will feel special, right?

00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:41.984
At least I know that the waste
should not be thrown around, right?

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:46.592
Really, I just heard it right, so moving

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:47.872
not sleeping

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:53.248
Okay, so we're going to talk
about security in this next lesson.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.112
Fire safety if you are
because you are back training?

00:00:58.368 --> 00:01:02.208
Then train back, I don't know if you
can watch horror movies in a hurry

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.091
do you dare?

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:08.608
Dare to watch it? Do you want to
watch the one with the broken hand?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.912
The one that got involved

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:15.520
It's a pity I wasn't prepared today

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.872
I'll be fine next time. Next time
I'm preparing for the next class.

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:25.504
Then why? Every time I have to say it,
it is very bloody and terrifying, right?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.368
I don't have it. We're not so bloody
because some people don't dare to watch

00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:35.488
Then one is that the company
has been hanging a lot recently

00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:38.816
Is there a big move in the production line?

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:42.737
For the big mobile and
then the engineers are very

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.728
hard. Moving this machine
is applying every day.

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:51.616
Okay, what are the dangers of the
hanging and the moving machine?

00:01:56.224 --> 00:01:57.760
Is there any danger

00:01:58.016 --> 00:01:59.296
can you walk over

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.600
can not be swayed

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:07.488
Can you watch it from the upstairs opening?

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:10.048
Can't

00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:11.072
What else

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:16.192
How many people do you
need for a moving table?

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:24.233
Two or more, right? You
have all seen that flyer.

00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:27.712
But have you seen that video?

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:29.760
Squeezed video

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.832
Oh, it's a pity that I
didn't prepare for it today.

00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:39.232
But it doesn't matter. This time, this
propaganda should be quite sufficient.

00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:46.048
This is to let us know if there is a
move in the field, if there is a colleague

00:02:46.073 --> 00:02:49.984
Never be alone at the handling machine

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.056
And moving cabinets

00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:56.128
Can't be alone

00:02:56.384 --> 00:03:00.089
Because some machines
have some attributes of that

00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.527
cabinet, we sometimes
don't know much about it.

00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:09.696
How is he like he might be prone to
dumping so we have to be trained to move

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:12.768
Now it's all entrusted to that manufacturer

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:17.082
This is the manufacturer to do the
handling because they are trained

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:20.693
and the other is if the employees
in the factory are handling

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.776
Please do tell them this

00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:26.848
Tips on how to move

00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:30.176
How not to get hurt, what shoes to wear

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.224
safety shoes

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.528
Can I wear slippers when
I come to the company?

00:03:35.808 --> 00:03:39.136
No, have you ever been
photographed by our people?

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:42.720
no good to you

00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:47.328
That's all right. Why don't
you wear slippers to work?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.632
why

00:03:51.424 --> 00:03:52.192
not good-looking

00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:55.776
It's not just bad looking, what else?

00:03:57.568 --> 00:04:00.640
I'm just afraid you'll slip when you see

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:07.552
I know that if you compare
convenience, you might go

00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:10.880
Is the production line right? Wear socks

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.160
then wear slippers

00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:13.952
It will be slippery

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:19.583
Hope everyone can wear a
comfortable shoe this should be in

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.935
The fourth class should talk
about factory care related to health

00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:27.775
Then trouble everyone, because recently

00:04:29.823 --> 00:04:32.895
especially the night shift

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.807
Especially my colleagues, please
stop wearing slippers to work.

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:42.367
I see it will open ENC

00:04:47.743 --> 00:04:51.327
Why do you need to talk about
the hanging just now? Because

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:54.399
We see this hanging actually

00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:58.751
When you see it on the road, you
might still pass by on a bike, right?

00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:01.567
You will pass but I don't dare

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:02.591
why

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.407
because i think it's scary

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:07.455
why is it scary

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.247
because of

00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:12.575
he's not careful

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:21.023
This is out of my control,
it may be an accident

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:26.143
But we, if you are, we should
have direct personnel by now

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:29.727
And the engineer in that office

00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:34.847
Then if you are doing
this kind of hair package

00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:36.639
Then you have to pay special attention

00:05:36.895 --> 00:05:40.479
Whether the manufacturer
is not a qualified manufacturer

00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:44.831
And then have they done
these protections in place?

00:05:45.087 --> 00:05:47.391
Then it's like this

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.999
This picture is the
original red hat is not here

00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:57.119
Well, our company, that's
fine, that means we'll inform this

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.143
red hat

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.191
The red hat is the overseer

00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:01.727
overseer

00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:05.823
Gotta be here so if I didn't
see him here it would be

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:12.454
stop him he told him to be around

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:21.670
Make sure our employees are on the sidewalk

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:25.197
It's not okay to walk out of
the warehouse. We will strictly

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:28.607
stop it. I believe that my
employees are all abiding by it.

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:34.502
In addition, I would like to
ask you about the escalator of

00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:38.237
the MRT high-speed rail station
in the usual department store.

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:39.615
Is there any harm

00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:43.455
do you think there is?

00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.575
If there are too many people,
will there be too few people?

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:52.927
what kind of hazard

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:55.231
it's okay to think about it

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:59.583
what harm

00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:07.263
come down

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:08.543
is it possible

00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:10.335
yes, yes

00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:17.247
The easiest is to get involved

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.807
the other escalator

00:07:22.623 --> 00:07:25.439
The brush is to keep
you from getting too close

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:31.071
I'm afraid that you will be caught in that
gap. Anyway, you only need your shoes or

00:07:31.327 --> 00:07:37.215
Anything that can get caught in him is at
risk of getting caught, so is his crevice

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:43.103
That's why our MRT station told you that

00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:46.175
Be careful to get involved
by the edge of the ladder

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.967
So if children wear

00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:51.039
these shoes

00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:52.831
Is he slippers?

00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:56.471
It should be the slippers
that have a special

00:07:56.483 --> 00:07:59.487
warning sign telling
you not to rely on this

00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:02.303
Be careful to get involved
in the edge of the ladder

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:07.935
Well, it's not that scary.

00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:11.519
This is what I wanted to say that day

00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:14.079
It doesn't seem like this

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:15.359
news

00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:18.565
I was looking for it before,
and I saw that the boy's

00:08:18.577 --> 00:08:21.759
feet were involved in the
escalator at Tamsui MRT Station.

00:08:22.783 --> 00:08:25.343
How it got involved we don't know but

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:28.927
We know we don't do this unsafe action

00:08:29.183 --> 00:08:32.255
Because he's naked after all

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.839
He's an escalator he can't cover

00:08:36.095 --> 00:08:40.191
It is actually possible to cover
it, it should be possible to put that

00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:46.591
place to cover or what to do or what
to design but for now it looks like he is

00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:49.151
The only way to prevent this involvement is

00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:50.431
remind everyone

00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:54.271
Don't go near that place,
right? He still has a gap

00:08:57.343 --> 00:09:00.159
Alright, let's get to the topic

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.207
How can you say something like

00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:08.095
What about these things from the
hanging pallets we saw in the company

00:09:08.607 --> 00:09:11.167
And then on the side of the road

00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:17.567
On the road then there will be escalators
seen in public places and what else?

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:20.895
Do you know what is the most
work-related injury in our company?

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:24.106
do you know?

00:09:24.837 --> 00:09:26.344
Inside or outside the factory

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.307
Someone in the factory said it
was dangerous inside the factory

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:33.628
Inside or outside the factory

00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:37.055
Why is it outside the factory?

00:09:38.303 --> 00:09:39.071
What's wrong

00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.375
ride a bike

00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:43.167
ride a motorcycle

00:09:43.423 --> 00:09:44.959
bike to work

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:50.335
a lot really a lot

00:09:50.605 --> 00:09:55.054
Sometimes I get a stack of wounded

00:09:55.967 --> 00:09:58.271
You will feel incredible, right?

00:09:58.527 --> 00:09:59.807
Especially at

00:10:00.575 --> 00:10:01.855
July and August

00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:07.231
The boy was injured while riding

00:10:07.487 --> 00:10:09.791
Slips for many reasons

00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:12.863
Then the fall

00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:15.303
some got hit

00:10:15.494 --> 00:10:17.008
flash car

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.224
all have

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:23.103
You really have to be careful
when you ride your bike, especially

00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:25.663
drive by motorcycle

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.101
These land
transportation is actually a

00:10:28.113 --> 00:10:30.527
part that we should
pay special attention to

00:10:30.783 --> 00:10:36.284
In addition, we actually have
more environmental security here.

00:10:36.415 --> 00:10:39.906
After a while, I will
do a little bit of off-site

00:10:39.918 --> 00:10:42.790
accident to get this
propaganda to avoid.

00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:47.167
Did you see that we have a
locomotive safety campaign

00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:54.335
His poster was ours at the beginning,
so we will do other things in the follow-up

00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:57.919
We would hope to have some courses

00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:01.588
It can be given to those
colleagues who may have

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.575
had work-related injuries
outside the factory.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.439
Or colleagues who are interested in this

00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:14.303
You may be able to notice things that
haven't happened while you're riding

00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:16.351
is it possible

00:11:16.607 --> 00:11:19.167
you know the car ahead

00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:24.543
He's about to hit you or if you
see him he's going left to right

00:11:25.328 --> 00:11:26.861
This is called defensive driving

00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:30.687
Defensive driving makes you predictable

00:11:30.943 --> 00:11:33.247
should you slow down

00:11:33.503 --> 00:11:35.295
because others may

00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:37.087
Unsafe action

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:40.927
That's what we hope to be able to

00:11:41.183 --> 00:11:42.975
Hurry up to plan one

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:45.023
train

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:48.658
Well, it's written that
the smallest family fire,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.654
personal traffic accident,
has a huge impact

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:52.959
factory explosion

00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:57.823
Major traffic accident prevention is
the establishment of safety culture

00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:59.615
with continued growth

00:12:01.663 --> 00:12:02.687
what to rely on

00:12:07.242 --> 00:12:09.235
rely on me?

00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:12.769
In fact, it depends on everyone

00:12:13.183 --> 00:12:19.327
It's not that the general manager told you
that the safety culture was established.

00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:21.119
is established, right?

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:26.133
If our colleagues see the
problem and don't respond

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.236
Someday someone will fall

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:31.253
If you saw that there were
street lights on the road

00:12:31.265 --> 00:12:33.443
and the lights turned off,
do you want to tell me?

00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:36.223
Our colleagues usually speak

00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:38.015
And if you see

00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:42.111
The machine needs to be maintained,
but the power is not turned off

00:12:42.367 --> 00:12:44.159
Do you dare to use it?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.023
Turn off the electricity, tag
and lock, we hope to be able to

00:12:50.815 --> 00:12:54.165
Going deeper to push
this thing out, that is, can

00:12:54.177 --> 00:12:57.471
you really turn off the
power during maintenance?

00:12:57.727 --> 00:13:02.847
Some machines have no way
but have other safety measures

00:13:03.103 --> 00:13:06.175
We know there are other safety measures but

00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:08.479
Turning off the electricity,
tagging and locking is the most

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:12.319
A security measure that will not be missed

00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:16.159
The other is to say

00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:17.951
this culture

00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:21.535
I believe our colleagues have heard

00:13:22.232 --> 00:13:23.982
Stop and Fix

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:27.262
Have heard of Stop and Fixp

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.370
The company uses these Slogans

00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:35.615
And like our ATQM

00:13:35.871 --> 00:13:37.663
There is a lot of quality here

00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:44.063
These activities make our colleagues
really start from the grassroots level

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:45.599
a lot of participation

00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:48.159
The security guard here is

00:13:48.415 --> 00:13:50.463
Hope to have your participation

00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:53.023
Did you find any problems

00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:54.815
be sure to return

00:13:55.071 --> 00:13:55.839
must speak

00:13:56.095 --> 00:14:00.959
come and ask you this comic

00:14:03.007 --> 00:14:04.031
the first is

00:14:10.453 --> 00:14:13.803
There's a place where it's about to break

00:14:14.094 --> 00:14:18.144
The hook is a little loose

00:14:18.202 --> 00:14:21.785
Or about to break

00:14:22.207 --> 00:14:24.511
This is an unsafe

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:26.559
environment

00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:30.224
Then there's someone walking
downstairs without a helmet

00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:32.166
someone walks underneath

00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:38.370
It's an unsafe act to just walk past

00:14:39.103 --> 00:14:40.639
unsafe behavior

00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:43.455
incomplete action

00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:46.882
The third one fell off

00:14:47.401 --> 00:14:49.523
Did you get hit in front of them?

00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:50.879
No

00:14:50.904 --> 00:14:54.397
It doesn't matter if it doesn't hit
them, they'll just go to the surprise.

00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:58.559
It's called Near Miss,
what we call a false alarm.

00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:02.143
Okay, come again, okay
next time someone walks by

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:04.671
second third fourth fourth

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:08.799
Okay maybe lucky to get to the 300th

00:15:09.311 --> 00:15:13.407
301 was hit

00:15:14.687 --> 00:15:15.967
this is

00:15:16.223 --> 00:15:18.271
I don't know if I go to heaven or hell

00:15:18.783 --> 00:15:21.599
It was an accident so we have

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:27.999
With maybe 300 false alarms,
he could cause a serious accident

00:15:28.807 --> 00:15:33.447
What is a false alarm

00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:38.239
Because we often go to the production line

00:15:38.824 --> 00:15:42.399
You may have seen
someone hit by the

00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:46.677
machine, many minor
problems are not serious

00:15:47.005 --> 00:15:52.005
Someone next to me will say
that I was like that at the time.

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.246
I was hit by that thing last time too.

00:15:56.182 --> 00:15:58.409
We asked him why no one told us?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.580
will you speak

00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:07.089
Do you need to tell the foreman if
you cut your hand and use the OK jump?

00:16:09.727 --> 00:16:12.031
usual tool

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.335
accidentally let you

00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:15.103
let you

00:16:15.359 --> 00:16:19.199
Maybe you were good at first,
but you didn't cut it that day.

00:16:19.967 --> 00:16:22.015
smashed, smashed

00:16:22.418 --> 00:16:24.780
If you suffer a little
injury, hurry up and

00:16:24.792 --> 00:16:27.165
pack a bag and continue
to work. Don't talk.

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:30.975
These false alarms we hope

00:16:31.231 --> 00:16:32.255
From

00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:33.791
start this year

00:16:34.047 --> 00:16:35.839
Colleagues can be brave

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.655
to say this happened

00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:39.935
Such a thing

00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:43.263
Because the false alarm
story has to be improved

00:16:44.543 --> 00:16:48.127
Our original first aid kit

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.407
I put OK jump in the first
aid kit, where is it now?

00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:55.400
Now put the stairs

00:16:55.454 --> 00:16:57.720
put a lot before

00:16:58.419 --> 00:16:59.606
less now

00:17:00.092 --> 00:17:01.906
First aid kits are scarce

00:17:03.623 --> 00:17:08.103
I want to say why everyone gets
hurt, every day someone gets hurt

00:17:08.634 --> 00:17:10.860
Every day someone takes OK to jump

00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:13.471
I don't know what was hurt

00:17:13.983 --> 00:17:15.519
So we hope

00:17:15.775 --> 00:17:20.895
Learn what our employees
look like from these managements

00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:22.175
under action

00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:23.455
at work

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.503
will have these

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:29.855
Small injury, let's go to explain from

00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:35.487
Is there any room for improvement? In fact,
we have found some points for improvement.

00:17:35.743 --> 00:17:38.047
There was a colleague who was

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:44.447
It's normal for him to cut his
hands easily when doing certain jobs

00:17:45.215 --> 00:17:45.983
it's normal

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:47.775
That's how his hands are

00:17:48.031 --> 00:17:50.079
He thought the glove might be useless

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:52.861
But after we got to know it, I
was very responsible as the

00:17:52.873 --> 00:17:55.455
environmental safety and health
committee of our department.

00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:58.015
who will find out who

00:17:58.271 --> 00:18:00.575
what kind of protective gear they can use

00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:04.927
Cut-resistant gloves to help
them so they won't be cutting

00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:06.463
cuts are not normal

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:09.023
those are not normal

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:15.654
So we learn from these questions
like this that we hope that our colleagues

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:22.054
If you are a direct employee,
you can use e-ID or union

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:24.127
reflect these recommendations

00:18:24.383 --> 00:18:25.151
In addition,

00:18:25.407 --> 00:18:28.735
Through the supervisor and the
environmental safety and health committee

00:18:29.086 --> 00:18:32.046
If the environmental
safety and health committee

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:34.970
does not know who it is,
you can ask the foreman

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:38.207
you, if you are

00:18:38.463 --> 00:18:40.511
You can find it directly
on the production line

00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:42.303
Find that foreman like this

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:45.375
then or

00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:48.191
you have some special

00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:54.591
Safety, health and
environmental protection issues

00:18:54.847 --> 00:18:57.575
You want to tell the
environmental security personnel

00:18:57.587 --> 00:19:00.479
directly that they can also
use it to give you a pipeline

00:19:01.503 --> 00:19:04.831
There is a poster of us in our warehouse

00:19:05.081 --> 00:19:06.398
what about this poster

00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:07.647
tell you

00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:12.814
If there are environmental health and
safety issues that have not been resolved

00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:14.756
what is not resolved

00:19:14.815 --> 00:19:17.375
Do you think it's been said many times?

00:19:17.887 --> 00:19:21.215
I don't seem to know when to improve

00:19:21.471 --> 00:19:25.823
You want to tell us
through a channel like this

00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:31.668
You can directly scan
the QRcode and fill in it

00:19:31.693 --> 00:19:33.803
When filling out, you still need to

00:19:34.015 --> 00:19:38.111
Fill in your real name and
phone number and let us know

00:19:38.367 --> 00:19:42.719
What do we do we have to tell
you, for example, we will tell you

00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:46.559
We're going to see it live
or say what we do to improve

00:19:46.815 --> 00:19:49.119
Then I will communicate with you first

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:49.887
so

00:19:50.813 --> 00:19:56.663
You can use this pipe next to the union

00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:02.175
The wall next to the milk collection
room has this pipe on the dining room side.

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:05.503
That or as you say a lot right?

00:20:08.482 --> 00:20:11.135
Foreman of Environmental
Safety and Health Committee

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.099
In fact, anyone can report

00:20:16.255 --> 00:20:17.279
come again

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:24.447
Well, we just happened to mention
that another restaurant has a phone

00:20:24.703 --> 00:20:27.288
This is also the phone
number if you don't

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.079
have the company's
phone if something happens.

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:32.560
In need of emergency
contact there is a phone

00:20:32.572 --> 00:20:35.254
number in the vegetarian
section of the restaurant

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:39.981
This call isn't for you to
order a drink, it's for you

00:20:40.063 --> 00:20:45.439
If it's really an emergency,
use this phone and there will be

00:20:45.695 --> 00:20:50.878
The guard room also has an
extension for our factory affairs.

00:20:55.423 --> 00:20:57.215
ok and then again

00:20:57.471 --> 00:21:01.055
Because I just talked about home safety

00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:04.895
you come to work you are from home

00:21:05.407 --> 00:21:11.551
We should all be safe when we
go home after work at the company.

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:15.135
happy

00:21:15.391 --> 00:21:16.416
then go home

00:21:16.672 --> 00:21:19.563
Then it's the same at home.
We have to celebrate the Spring

00:21:19.575 --> 00:21:22.816
Festival. We hope that all colleagues
can have a good time at home.

00:21:23.072 --> 00:21:25.888
You can relax and come back

00:21:26.144 --> 00:21:27.936
Refresh and go to work, right?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.520
Then let's take a look

00:21:31.776 --> 00:21:33.056
fire this piece

00:21:33.253 --> 00:21:36.607
I won't talk about the
company in particular here

00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:39.200
a situation of

00:21:39.456 --> 00:21:43.296
In terms of home fire
prevention, because of this we

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.523
It was not mentioned
in the previous

00:21:45.535 --> 00:21:48.160
environmental safety and
health course comparison

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:52.768
That hope he can be
prevented from this home fire

00:21:53.024 --> 00:21:56.864
to recognize and to understand

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.704
how to identify and

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:08.128
Know more about these little
knowledge about the prevention of this fire

00:22:09.152 --> 00:22:11.273
Let's take a look. In
fact, electrical appliances

00:22:11.285 --> 00:22:13.504
are now using a lot of
electrical appliances, right?

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.904
There are people who use mobile phones and
tablets, many small appliances, and so on.

00:22:19.929 --> 00:22:23.232
In fact, the first is the electrical fire

00:22:24.512 --> 00:22:26.304
good to see a picture

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.376
The storage of this fan

00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:30.912
we're gonna take this

00:22:31.168 --> 00:22:34.240
The wires must be tied up, right?

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.080
Is that safe?

00:22:40.128 --> 00:22:41.920
is this safe

00:22:42.688 --> 00:22:45.760
Is this neat but safer?

00:22:46.528 --> 00:22:47.552
think about it

00:22:50.112 --> 00:22:56.256
The extension cord you just bought
will actually bundle it up for you.

00:22:57.024 --> 00:22:58.048
sell

00:22:58.304 --> 00:22:59.584
ok that's neat

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.912
But is this arrangement safe?

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:08.288
Just think about it, right?

00:23:12.384 --> 00:23:14.944
Well, that's actually
because when I was a kid

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.248
When I was a child, my mother would tell us

00:23:17.504 --> 00:23:20.832
You'll see a lot of people
tying him up like this

00:23:21.088 --> 00:23:22.624
Because it's neater

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:23.904
good but

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.488
But it's not really safe

00:23:29.536 --> 00:23:31.840
watch a video

00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:38.647
Many fire scenes are
caused by extension cords

00:23:38.672 --> 00:23:41.341
Some are plugging too many electrical
appliances at one time and overloading

00:23:41.366 --> 00:23:43.582
Some people forget to turn off the
power supply and the wires go off.

00:23:43.606 --> 00:23:45.408
However, a man surnamed
Wang in New Taipei City

00:23:45.664 --> 00:23:47.194
Suspected that the
extension cord was

00:23:47.206 --> 00:23:48.992
turned off, but it still
caused a fire alarm

00:23:49.248 --> 00:23:52.011
At that time, the man surnamed Wang
plugged the electric fan into the extension

00:23:52.023 --> 00:23:54.624
cord and did not expect the extension
cord to cause a fire after going out.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.916
The woman surnamed Huang
who lives on the 11th floor

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.976
Let's listen again I've just been

00:23:59.232 --> 00:24:01.536
I didn't enlarge him, wait a minute

00:24:07.936 --> 00:24:10.518
Many fire scenes are
caused by extension cords

00:24:10.543 --> 00:24:13.056
Some are plugging too many electrical
appliances at one time and overloading

00:24:13.312 --> 00:24:15.360
Some people forget to turn off the
power supply and the wires go off.

00:24:15.616 --> 00:24:18.377
However, a man surnamed Wang in New
Taipei City was suspected to have turned

00:24:18.389 --> 00:24:21.125
off the power supply of the extension
cord, but it still caused a fire alarm

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.808
At that time, the man surnamed Wang plugged
the electric fan into the extension cord

00:24:24.064 --> 00:24:30.697
Unexpectedly, the extension
line caused a fire after going out

00:24:30.722 --> 00:24:32.838
The man surnamed Wang
uses an extension cord

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.119
with an independent
switch like this in the room

00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:36.864
But he said he had an
electric fan at the time

00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:40.832
Does your extension cord look like this?

00:24:41.728 --> 00:24:42.496
right

00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:45.568
Ah, does your family have
anything attached to it?

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.360
will automatically jump

00:24:48.128 --> 00:24:51.968
That one is more expensive, but
there is this independent switch, right?

00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:55.552
That's the same thing they
use, our family also uses this

00:24:56.064 --> 00:24:57.344
take a look

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.648
is not running

00:24:59.904 --> 00:25:01.633
And the switch is also off

00:25:01.657 --> 00:25:04.768
He therefore thinks that there
has been no negligence in his use

00:25:05.024 --> 00:25:08.047
The man surnamed Wang told the prosecution
that his extension line had been used

00:25:08.059 --> 00:25:11.168
for less than 7 months and that the extension
line had passed the safety inspection

00:25:11.424 --> 00:25:13.728
There is also an overload automatic
power-off protection mechanism

00:25:13.984 --> 00:25:15.928
There is also an independent
switch on the socket, and

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.824
there was only one electric
fan missing at that time.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.047
However, after inspection,
the police confirmed that the

00:25:20.059 --> 00:25:22.176
extension cord only needs to
be connected to the wall socket.

00:25:22.432 --> 00:25:23.712
power-on state

00:25:23.968 --> 00:25:26.881
It is believed that the man surnamed
Wang did not notice that the extension

00:25:26.893 --> 00:25:29.856
cord was damaged and caused trouble,
and was sentenced to death by negligence

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.416
Is this serious?

00:25:32.928 --> 00:25:36.000
If you have not unplugged
the extension cord at home

00:25:36.256 --> 00:25:39.072
and then cause someone else's

00:25:39.328 --> 00:25:42.144
It should be said that
someone else died at home

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.073
This will still be sentenced. Of
course, this can still be appealed.

00:25:46.085 --> 00:25:49.824
What I said here is that he said he
did not unplug the extension cord.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.640
In addition, the power-on state

00:25:52.896 --> 00:25:54.432
and then again

00:25:54.944 --> 00:25:59.552
The plastic outer film is deteriorating
so like you have checked at home

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:01.856
Do you have an extension
cord in your house?

00:26:02.624 --> 00:26:05.184
Someone will check I think it's great

00:26:05.696 --> 00:26:08.256
Especially the ones behind the cabinets

00:26:09.024 --> 00:26:10.048
pressed for a long time

00:26:10.304 --> 00:26:11.072
right

00:26:11.328 --> 00:26:13.888
I don't know what he looks like now, right?

00:26:14.144 --> 00:26:15.168
maybe even that

00:26:15.424 --> 00:26:16.704
I don't know where the socket is

00:26:17.984 --> 00:26:19.264
Is there such a pair

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.312
because you lived for a long time?

00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:28.224
I watched a video the other day, it is
not convenient to put that video here

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.832
It's just that there's
a video, he's directly

00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:34.368
Measured above

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.672
Test this extension cord

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.232
little

00:26:41.024 --> 00:26:42.560
what card is it small?

00:26:42.816 --> 00:26:46.656
Or some Taiwan-made or

00:26:46.912 --> 00:26:48.704
general traditional

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.984
Extension cord

00:26:50.496 --> 00:26:51.520
That's actually

00:26:52.032 --> 00:26:54.336
he will advertise

00:26:54.848 --> 00:26:56.640
Overload he will jump

00:26:56.896 --> 00:27:02.272
Or maybe he's going to advertise a
lot of things but he doesn't have to be

00:27:02.528 --> 00:27:05.683
So after passing through,
some people may take it

00:27:05.695 --> 00:27:08.672
apart to see if it is
really like what he said.

00:27:08.928 --> 00:27:11.744
That's probably not true

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.840
So something like what we
bought back is good especially

00:27:16.096 --> 00:27:18.656
this extension cord if you

00:27:19.168 --> 00:27:20.704
leave home

00:27:21.216 --> 00:27:24.228
Maybe it will take a long time
to go out, or we can promote it

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.360
in the office of the company, if
it is during the Spring Festival

00:27:27.616 --> 00:27:30.432
Before the Spring
Festival, please send your

00:27:30.688 --> 00:27:31.712
extension cord

00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:33.760
unplugged

00:27:34.016 --> 00:27:35.040
be sure to unplug

00:27:35.552 --> 00:27:38.112
At that time, there may be
another propaganda such as this

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:42.886
Then if you have such a habit in your
home, this is the establishment of a safety

00:27:42.898 --> 00:27:47.328
culture. Everyone in the family knows that
you have to pull the plug when you go out.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.960
This is important because you
really don't know if it's like this, right?

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:55.776
Don't you take care of it every day?

00:27:56.032 --> 00:27:56.544
Do you have

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.568
ah no

00:27:57.824 --> 00:27:59.616
Let's go to the next one

00:28:01.152 --> 00:28:04.346
Ask everyone, which one of
these four electrical appliances

00:28:04.358 --> 00:28:07.296
do you think is more likely
to have an electrical fire?

00:28:08.555 --> 00:28:14.023
On the left is the heater

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:14.976
what is the top right

00:28:16.512 --> 00:28:18.560
Cool, what else?

00:28:19.584 --> 00:28:20.352
electric fan

00:28:21.632 --> 00:28:22.656
dehumidifier

00:28:23.594 --> 00:28:24.704
which one do you think

00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:25.984
easier to happen

00:28:28.032 --> 00:28:30.080
Do you think the frequency is high?

00:28:31.616 --> 00:28:32.640
still the same

00:28:32.896 --> 00:28:34.403
electric heater

00:28:34.944 --> 00:28:36.480
do you often use electric heaters

00:28:37.504 --> 00:28:40.576
It may not be used in winter

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.648
So which one is the most commonly used

00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:47.141
Electric fans are most
commonly used for electric fans,

00:28:47.153 --> 00:28:49.792
and the frequency of
electric fans is relatively high.

00:28:50.048 --> 00:28:52.864
So actually the fan is really

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.984
Give him regular maintenance
because he gets dust stuck on it

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.312
Then if he doesn't move,
then you keep giving him

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.640
He's been on the power all
the time, he might just suddenly

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.712
Otherwise it will catch fire

00:29:08.224 --> 00:29:09.248
really catch fire

00:29:09.504 --> 00:29:11.808
So like this we usually

00:29:12.064 --> 00:29:16.672
There are a lot of commonly used electrical
appliances in the home to pay attention to

00:29:17.952 --> 00:29:27.424
Why is this course designed like this
because we are often watching the news

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.228
Lots of fires in that house

00:29:31.253 --> 00:29:34.035
You won't know why this fire happened

00:29:34.336 --> 00:29:37.152
You won't know because he won't tell you

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.024
In fact, many of the

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.560
from these appliances

00:29:55.072 --> 00:29:56.352
you may not imagine

00:29:56.608 --> 00:29:59.947
Then we hope that all of you
colleagues have this knowledge

00:29:59.959 --> 00:30:02.752
in the training that you
have attended this round.

00:30:04.032 --> 00:30:07.104
Let's take a look at the fouling conductive

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:16.680
Put the cotton on the plug
first and then into the socket

00:30:16.705 --> 00:30:24.256
Create a dusty state between
the iron plug and the socket

00:30:29.888 --> 00:30:31.680
pouring water

00:30:40.896 --> 00:30:45.248
After a while, white smoke appeared
directly from the plug and socket

00:31:12.384 --> 00:31:18.528
The flame is more than 20 cm high

00:31:18.784 --> 00:31:22.624
The plug is completely burnt

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.720
temperature up to mild

00:31:36.192 --> 00:31:43.104
The last time I saw a case, he said that
the socket behind the cabinet caught fire.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.152
Is he just because it's
been useless for too long?

00:31:45.408 --> 00:31:48.224
Then he easily accumulates this dust

00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:52.320
On January 8th, I know you
guys are you going to work?

00:31:52.576 --> 00:31:54.880
Are you home without work?

00:31:55.136 --> 00:31:57.696
What are the factories and
manufacturers doing here?

00:31:59.488 --> 00:32:00.768
What's up on January 8th?

00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:05.632
Power outage and then the last two words
are very important, not just power outages

00:32:08.704 --> 00:32:09.472
blackout what

00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:11.776
Power outage maintenance

00:32:13.312 --> 00:32:15.104
do what

00:32:15.616 --> 00:32:17.408
put that dust

00:32:17.664 --> 00:32:21.504
Sweep the dust out of the
cabinets in the substation

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.064
clear it all

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:30.720
Do it once a year and that's
it, so how about you at home?

00:32:30.976 --> 00:32:35.584
It's not just about cleaning the floor

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.023
May be in this kind of
appliance, especially if you

00:32:39.035 --> 00:32:41.984
may pull the socket or
the extension cord on the

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.172
It's been too long for a place
you might want to clean it up wait

00:32:45.184 --> 00:32:48.128
a minute and talk about another
thing that needs to be cleaned too

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.296
We just talked about why not to bind

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.112
Something will happen to this bundle

00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:07.328
Bundle the wires together as you did before

00:33:07.584 --> 00:33:13.728
turn the power on

00:33:20.384 --> 00:33:26.528
After 3 minutes, white smoke
started to come out of the socket

00:33:32.489 --> 00:33:34.377
After another 30 seconds

00:33:38.695 --> 00:33:41.918
Fire occurs in the wire

00:33:52.384 --> 00:33:56.517
Measure with a thermometer

00:33:56.542 --> 00:34:03.136
Will find bundled wires up to 150 degrees

00:34:03.392 --> 00:34:05.696
The picture is very clear, right?

00:34:05.952 --> 00:34:12.096
The bundled wire above is
100 degrees, if you are at home

00:34:13.632 --> 00:34:16.192
But find an open space

00:34:16.448 --> 00:34:18.752
Also need a thermal imager

00:34:19.008 --> 00:34:21.824
Is it true that he will be over 100 degrees

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.640
It says 150 degrees on
it, next time you look at it

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:28.158
You can tell what the
difference is by looking at it, so

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.271
don't bundle the wires at
home and then the hair dryer

00:34:31.296 --> 00:34:36.928
Because of his high power and then he
finds out that the appliance is hot right?

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.976
absolutely not bound

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:42.304
This whole family has a sense of safety

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.912
Say don't tie, don't tie

00:34:47.424 --> 00:34:49.216
ok then don't bend

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.824
Can't be folded, can't
be tied, what should I do?

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.640
Then it's ok to collect it in large rolls

00:34:57.408 --> 00:35:00.480
Also, what is overloading?

00:35:00.736 --> 00:35:04.832
I just mentioned that the
overload switch will trip

00:35:05.088 --> 00:35:08.928
If it is overloaded, it will jump

00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:11.232
how to calculate

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.816
This simple calculation

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.728
When the current flowing through
the wire exceeds the safe capacity

00:35:21.984 --> 00:35:25.312
If the overload protection
switch fails, there is no action

00:35:25.568 --> 00:35:29.082
The high temperature generated by
the overcurrent will cause the insulation

00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:32.480
on the surface of the wire to melt and
carbonize or even cause combustion

00:35:33.504 --> 00:35:38.368
Have you noticed that the
extension cord is always full of plugs?

00:35:38.624 --> 00:35:41.184
Is the extension cord overloaded?

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.560
Let me explain to you how to calculate
if an extension cord is overloaded

00:35:46.816 --> 00:35:49.888
If the extension cord load is 15 amps

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.568
Three electrical
appliances plugged into an

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.008
extension cord at the
same time are electric pots

00:35:55.264 --> 00:35:57.824
His power consumption is 880 watts

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.104
Micro-wave oven

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.456
750 watt thermos is 110 watt

00:36:04.224 --> 00:36:07.040
Electric pot consumes 880 watts of power

00:36:07.296 --> 00:36:11.136
What is the voltage that
is usually used at home?

00:36:12.416 --> 00:36:18.560
110 is right, if you have
a pen, divide 750 by 100

00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:28.544
And how much does 880
divided by 110 add up?

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.408
so there is no more than 15 amps

00:36:34.176 --> 00:36:35.200
yes or no

00:36:35.968 --> 00:36:39.296
If this is exceeded, it is called overload.

00:36:39.808 --> 00:36:46.752
Therefore, there are many extension
cord sockets outside. There are

00:36:46.764 --> 00:36:53.311
six, eight, and three. He is
fully inserted and called overload.

00:36:53.888 --> 00:36:54.400
yes

00:36:55.168 --> 00:36:57.472
After this class, you'll know it's not

00:36:57.728 --> 00:37:03.872
But you have to calculate the power to use
this appliance and divide it by your usual

00:37:04.172 --> 00:37:07.552
Does the 110 add up
to exceed the load of the

00:37:07.564 --> 00:37:10.956
extension cord above,
which is usually 15 amps

00:37:11.808 --> 00:37:14.331
Okay, or you can usually
pay attention to whether

00:37:14.343 --> 00:37:16.928
your extension cord is
currently in good condition.

00:37:17.184 --> 00:37:21.280
It's very hot, you can't continue to
use it like this, you have to buy it again

00:37:21.536 --> 00:37:23.840
better his

00:37:24.096 --> 00:37:25.888
The extension cord is thicker.

00:37:27.168 --> 00:37:28.448
this is

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.496
small calculations

00:37:31.008 --> 00:37:32.288
I believe everyone will

00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:41.248
Well, let's take a look at a
very simple promotional video.

00:37:41.504 --> 00:37:43.552
This is your exam

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.245
What happened

00:37:53.792 --> 00:37:55.328
It's really convenient to
have an extension cord

00:37:56.118 --> 00:37:58.425
Can use a lot of
appliances at the same time

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:03.062
Blow your hair while
the hot water is boiling

00:38:06.891 --> 00:38:09.381
wonder what it tastes like

00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:15.644
What happened

00:38:17.236 --> 00:38:19.653
Electrical fires cannot
be extinguished with water

00:38:19.787 --> 00:38:22.165
Be sure to use a dry
powder fire extinguisher

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.230
Remember the following principles

00:38:24.255 --> 00:38:26.487
Do not overload

00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:31.424
Wires are not bundled

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.616
The plug is not wet and dirty

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.824
Unplug electrical
appliances when not in use

00:38:37.908 --> 00:38:42.775
Do not put combustibles
around the appliance

00:38:43.019 --> 00:38:46.688
Do not buy and do not use electrical
appliances without safety labels

00:38:46.756 --> 00:38:48.899
Watch out for signs of electrical fire

00:38:49.007 --> 00:38:50.629
lights dimmed

00:38:50.654 --> 00:38:52.138
Bulbs burn out frequently

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.350
hot wire

00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:56.001
smell of burning wires

00:38:56.026 --> 00:39:00.288
Switchboards often trip without fuses

00:39:02.144 --> 00:39:03.424
so that

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.984
What are our exam answers

00:39:07.776 --> 00:39:11.360
Are our exams on the above?

00:39:13.152 --> 00:39:16.992
So what's the harbinger of
something when this comes up?

00:39:18.016 --> 00:39:21.344
Symptoms of an electrical fire

00:39:38.496 --> 00:39:43.872
Let's take a look again,
time is running out

00:39:46.432 --> 00:39:49.131
This attention is to remember
not to accumulate dust,

00:39:49.143 --> 00:39:51.552
do not squeeze, do not
bind, and do not overload

00:39:51.808 --> 00:39:53.088
then use

00:39:53.344 --> 00:39:57.440
Safety label products must have
at least this is the minimum standard

00:39:57.696 --> 00:39:58.720
say if you are

00:39:59.232 --> 00:40:03.072
Group purchases must pay
attention to buying electrical appliances

00:40:03.328 --> 00:40:05.888
Be sure to pay attention to the best brands

00:40:06.912 --> 00:40:08.960
Did we test this? You write so seriously

00:40:13.824 --> 00:40:16.772
Remember that we have
seen a lot of videos just now,

00:40:16.784 --> 00:40:19.968
right? And then we saw some
explanations and let you know

00:40:20.224 --> 00:40:23.296
You go home today just to pay attention

00:40:23.808 --> 00:40:25.088
especially during the Spring Festival

00:40:25.344 --> 00:40:27.136
clean up before

00:40:27.648 --> 00:40:29.696
Check the plug at home

00:40:29.952 --> 00:40:30.976
Extension cord

00:40:31.232 --> 00:40:34.048
If you want to replace
it, just replace it, okay?

00:40:42.496 --> 00:40:47.104
So don't collect dust, don't
squeeze, don't bundle, don't overload

00:40:47.616 --> 00:40:48.896
Don't be overloaded

00:40:49.408 --> 00:40:50.176
remember

00:40:50.944 --> 00:40:52.992
Divide that voltage by 110 pairs

00:40:53.248 --> 00:40:56.576
I'll take a look at home

00:41:01.952 --> 00:41:03.488
your home plug

00:41:03.744 --> 00:41:05.024
It will be hot to the touch

00:41:05.792 --> 00:41:09.888
Look at the water and
electricity, this is a precursor

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:13.472
blackened is worse

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.568
It's the same when we just talked about
the maintenance of electrical appliances

00:41:17.824 --> 00:41:20.384
Manufacturers will also come
to see these in our company

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.504
Are the wires in the substation black?

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.230
Hurry up, we may skip this first, let's
watch this video, it's the power bank

00:41:32.255 --> 00:41:35.837
Although the fire was extinguished,
the remaining smoke continued to escape

00:41:35.849 --> 00:41:39.584
from the third floor around 3:00 a.m. on
Guanghua Road, Luzhou, New Taipei City

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.823
The man in the apartment
house was on fire, and the man's

00:41:42.835 --> 00:41:45.984
hand was burned until he
woke up, only to find it was on fire

00:41:53.663 --> 00:41:56.753
The computer starts to burn

00:41:56.778 --> 00:42:00.531
So what time did he catch the fire?

00:42:01.855 --> 00:42:06.719
Sleep versus sleep is
usually the case so don't sleep

00:42:06.975 --> 00:42:09.535
Charge that is what to charge

00:42:10.047 --> 00:42:14.143
Don't go to charge from that
thing while sleeping and then

00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:16.191
put some combustibles

00:42:16.447 --> 00:42:18.495
look further down

00:42:18.751 --> 00:42:20.543
this is

00:42:20.799 --> 00:42:24.383
Everyone should not know about
this news that happened before.

00:42:27.646 --> 00:42:30.142
Come to care about what
happened yesterday morning

00:42:30.154 --> 00:42:32.712
at the cash cabinet KTV
on Linsen North Road, Taipei

00:42:32.738 --> 00:42:37.414
Fire accident killed 5 people, more
than 50 injured and sent to hospital

00:42:37.469 --> 00:42:41.254
What's the cause of the fire?
The police have an update today

00:42:41.279 --> 00:42:44.070
The monitor screen on the 5th
floor of the KTV building was exposed

00:42:44.116 --> 00:42:47.082
At 9:07 a.m., a foreman
surnamed Wang who

00:42:47.094 --> 00:42:50.214
was working on the
building's elevator works

00:42:50.239 --> 00:42:53.226
He holds a laser rangefinder in his hand

00:42:53.251 --> 00:42:56.836
Go into the storage room to
charge the battery of this rangefinder

00:42:56.903 --> 00:43:00.903
After 105 minutes, it
is 10:52 in the morning

00:43:00.954 --> 00:43:04.409
Surveillance footage captured the
fire coming out of the storage room

00:43:04.434 --> 00:43:06.082
Then it started to burn

00:43:06.368 --> 00:43:10.430
The police rescued the foreman Wang
surnamed today and transferred him to the

00:43:10.442 --> 00:43:14.568
District Prosecutor's Office on suspicion
of negligent death and public danger.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.680
The latest news after the news is
that he pays 100,000 yuan on bail

00:43:17.705 --> 00:43:20.973
And restricting the outbound
and sea also restricts the footprint

00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:25.213
The man in black walked
around with the wires

00:43:25.225 --> 00:43:27.150
and then turned back
to the storage room

00:43:27.226 --> 00:43:29.892
Open the curtains, bend
over and squat down to charge

00:43:29.917 --> 00:43:32.907
No one came in or out during
the work in the construction area

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.550
Shortly afterward the
storage room was on fire

00:43:35.595 --> 00:43:38.845
Then the fire got bigger and bigger

00:43:38.892 --> 00:43:41.951
It's not a few minutes

00:43:42.207 --> 00:43:44.511
He just took something like an instrument

00:43:44.767 --> 00:43:50.399
We most often use a thing called a
vacuum cleaner in the production line

00:43:50.842 --> 00:43:52.992
that needs charging

00:43:53.215 --> 00:43:55.007
what else to charge

00:43:56.031 --> 00:43:57.055
wireless

00:43:57.311 --> 00:43:59.871
the wireless one

00:44:00.383 --> 00:44:04.479
Everything you will use at home
needs to be charged like a cell phone

00:44:04.735 --> 00:44:08.782
These are all to be
charged. In the production

00:44:08.794 --> 00:44:11.903
line, we will ask
everyone to locate

00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:15.479
It's the battery charger
that gives you a place

00:44:15.705 --> 00:44:19.170
At this location, he
needs CCTV surveillance

00:44:19.182 --> 00:44:21.887
or someone where
you often pass by.

00:44:22.143 --> 00:44:25.060
Then there can be no
combustibles within two meters

00:44:25.072 --> 00:44:27.775
because if he burns, he
won't spread to the side

00:44:28.031 --> 00:44:30.079
So this is the rule of the line

00:44:30.335 --> 00:44:34.943
The other one is

00:44:35.199 --> 00:44:36.479
That is to say, the battery

00:44:38.527 --> 00:44:39.295
take a quick look

00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:40.831
Use lithium batteries

00:44:41.087 --> 00:44:43.647
Something to watch out for, especially now

00:44:43.903 --> 00:44:47.487
A lot of things that use power banks

00:44:47.743 --> 00:44:48.767
that if

00:44:49.023 --> 00:44:52.302
If you don't know where you
came from, he may spontaneously

00:44:52.314 --> 00:44:55.935
ignite. If you put the bag over
there, he will burn it by himself.

00:44:56.191 --> 00:44:57.215
This is actually

00:44:57.471 --> 00:44:59.007
many cases

00:44:59.519 --> 00:45:02.847
Pay special attention to
his mark when buying these

00:45:03.103 --> 00:45:06.083
Do not put in high temperature in summer

00:45:06.943 --> 00:45:11.004
Let's take a look at how
to minimize disasters. If

00:45:11.016 --> 00:45:15.647
because we are talking about
fire prevention at home today

00:45:15.903 --> 00:45:21.279
It should be said that in addition to
pulling the plug just mentioned, this is a

00:45:21.535 --> 00:45:22.815
there are other

00:45:23.583 --> 00:45:24.863
how to lower

00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:28.152
In fact, the fire department
of the Ministry of the

00:45:28.164 --> 00:45:31.007
Interior has written their
countermeasures this year.

00:45:31.414 --> 00:45:32.447
First

00:45:32.799 --> 00:45:36.639
Promote the use of extension
cords with overload protection devices

00:45:36.895 --> 00:45:39.967
To CNS check the combination
and come to the second one

00:45:40.223 --> 00:45:44.319
If your family has lived for more
than 20 years, he specially wrote this

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:45.855
assist in advocacy

00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:49.183
People have used indoor wiring
for more than 20 years at home

00:45:49.439 --> 00:45:54.303
Please invite qualified
electrical contractors to update

00:45:55.071 --> 00:45:57.887
No subsidy seems useless

00:45:58.143 --> 00:46:02.406
Because some really lived
for a long time, this is true, I

00:46:02.418 --> 00:46:06.693
saw it, so I was surprised
that he didn't ask for a subsidy

00:46:08.383 --> 00:46:12.479
The next one is to put
on the siren because it is

00:46:12.735 --> 00:46:14.527
predictable

00:46:15.039 --> 00:46:18.879
When there is a fire, let
me know to escape quickly

00:46:19.647 --> 00:46:23.231
Does the company have the
so-called function like this alarm device?

00:46:31.547 --> 00:46:33.197
it's over without us

00:46:34.798 --> 00:46:38.365
It's bad if you don't have it, we
have it, have you seen that white one?

00:46:42.943 --> 00:46:46.783
This smoke detector will
be installed in the company

00:46:47.039 --> 00:46:48.575
the white one

00:46:48.831 --> 00:46:52.159
You didn't find that he
ever had a false positive

00:46:53.183 --> 00:46:56.767
there is absolutely

00:46:57.023 --> 00:46:57.535
do you know

00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:00.446
It's not that we play
with fire, it's not the

00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:02.399
production line, there
are people of course not

00:47:02.655 --> 00:47:04.447
He will be like what he just said

00:47:04.703 --> 00:47:06.495
he might collect dust

00:47:07.007 --> 00:47:09.567
he might misreport

00:47:09.823 --> 00:47:13.151
Yeah, let's go back to the
one we're looking at now

00:47:13.407 --> 00:47:16.604
Therefore, if your home
is a Toutian apartment

00:47:16.616 --> 00:47:19.551
or a bungalow, it is
not a building anyway.

00:47:19.807 --> 00:47:21.599
The building will do it for you, right?

00:47:21.855 --> 00:47:25.586
There will be one that is
managed as a whole, but if your

00:47:25.598 --> 00:47:29.535
family is not yours, you live in
a rented apartment or you go

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:33.887
Rent an old house, he is in the sky, etc.

00:47:34.399 --> 00:47:38.239
It's better to ask everyone to
install this so-called police station

00:47:38.495 --> 00:47:41.055
like this one

00:47:41.311 --> 00:47:45.407
And then live the police,
in fact, he has two types

00:47:45.663 --> 00:47:47.711
1 is the smoke detection type

00:47:47.967 --> 00:47:52.319
Tobacco detection is just as the name
implies, it will sound when there is smoke.

00:47:52.575 --> 00:47:54.111
The second constant temperature

00:47:55.135 --> 00:47:57.695
Let everyone wake up quickly

00:47:58.207 --> 00:47:59.231
Where

00:47:59.487 --> 00:48:03.591
Where is your home you
need to install a thermostat

00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:08.351
The kitchen, wow 100 points

00:48:12.934 --> 00:48:15.901
Buddha hall, yes, there will be smoke

00:48:16.127 --> 00:48:18.175
That place will be
installed with a thermostat

00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:20.223
There will be two options

00:48:21.247 --> 00:48:23.983
Then I have to recognize
this safety mark. He

00:48:23.995 --> 00:48:26.623
still has a safety mark
and has been tested.

00:48:26.879 --> 00:48:28.415
which places

00:48:28.671 --> 00:48:31.291
The kitchen is
equipped with constant

00:48:31.303 --> 00:48:34.559
temperature staircases,
corridors and bedrooms.

00:48:35.327 --> 00:48:35.839
why

00:48:36.607 --> 00:48:38.655
Because you don't know where the fire is

00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:43.519
As soon as he's on fire, he
rings, and you'll know where it is

00:48:45.567 --> 00:48:51.199
The way he installs is very convenient,
but if it is sticky foam, it may fall off.

00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:55.039
I have experience with
this so I know it might fall off

00:48:55.551 --> 00:48:58.748
But it's a simple and
simple type and you have

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.695
to test it regularly
and then wipe it clean

00:49:01.951 --> 00:49:03.487
Because he just said that
he may have misreported

00:49:05.023 --> 00:49:06.815
Let's see what's going on

00:49:14.495 --> 00:49:20.639
The quiz has a flame and immediately emits
a 90 decibel broadcast plus a red light

00:49:20.895 --> 00:49:21.663
siren

00:49:21.919 --> 00:49:26.015
The key to life-saving when a fire occurs,
but how to install it is very important

00:49:26.271 --> 00:49:28.319
The idea of ​​the fool-proof device
boils down to plug it in first anyway

00:49:29.038 --> 00:49:31.647
Then when we operate, I will
first test whether it is normal.

00:49:31.672 --> 00:49:34.117
The test is normal, it
means the power is on

00:49:34.142 --> 00:49:37.535
Behind him is just that double-sided tape

00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:38.303
can

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:39.071
stuck

00:49:39.327 --> 00:49:42.374
When installing alarm aids, be sure to keep
them away from air-conditioning outlets

00:49:42.399 --> 00:49:47.519
Or at least 1.5 meters above the ceiling
fan and choose a sturdy place to install

00:49:47.775 --> 00:49:49.311
The alarm is very easy to install

00:49:49.567 --> 00:49:52.127
A 500 to 800 yuan plasma
battery can be used for 10 years

00:49:55.455 --> 00:49:58.783
You know what he's like if you
stick to it, you'll get hit by him

00:49:59.295 --> 00:50:01.087
really fall

00:50:02.111 --> 00:50:07.999
It's true. I just said that the foam
is right because my house fell off.

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:11.071
It's scary, I'm afraid of
falling and hitting my head

00:50:12.351 --> 00:50:13.887
Pay attention to where you put it

00:50:14.143 --> 00:50:15.679
If it is installed, it should be sturdy

00:50:15.935 --> 00:50:17.215
He has to be strong

00:50:18.239 --> 00:50:20.340
I'm done with this one

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:29.247
So again calling to fill up and then
another one is specifically mentioned here

00:50:30.271 --> 00:50:33.087
Reserve more than two escape exits

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:35.647
do we have two here

00:50:37.923 --> 00:50:43.623
Yes, there are two, we can
go from this way over there.

00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:49.471
Go to that many places
to sing and eat outside

00:50:49.727 --> 00:50:52.322
What should be paid attention
to when staying in hotels

00:50:52.334 --> 00:50:54.847
in public places is whether
there are two escape exits

00:50:55.103 --> 00:50:57.151
Pay attention to that when you go

00:50:57.919 --> 00:51:00.223
Is there any clearance
for the escape ladder?

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:04.575
Then I will tell you more about the company

00:51:04.831 --> 00:51:06.623
these escape ladders

00:51:06.879 --> 00:51:09.439
You can't put anything on the stairs.

00:51:09.695 --> 00:51:15.071
No escape ladder is not
the one for our employees

00:51:15.327 --> 00:51:17.631
life-saving route

00:51:20.191 --> 00:51:23.970
If you think the thing is very small,
put it away for a while. If you want to

00:51:23.982 --> 00:51:27.871
scrap it, put it away for a while. If
you take it down, put it away for a while.

00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:30.687
So this is strictly prohibited

00:51:31.967 --> 00:51:38.111
If you are renting

00:51:38.367 --> 00:51:41.183
renting or you are the landlord

00:51:41.439 --> 00:51:42.975
the landlord

00:51:43.231 --> 00:51:47.839
If you rent a house to someone else,
please help install this police device

00:51:48.095 --> 00:51:50.102
Kaohsiung City has this
self-government ordinance.

00:51:50.114 --> 00:51:51.935
If you are renting a
house, you can ask for it

00:51:52.447 --> 00:51:53.983
Just ask them to do it for you

00:51:54.239 --> 00:51:55.519
all ok

00:51:57.311 --> 00:51:59.615
then we today

00:52:00.127 --> 00:52:01.919
safety and fire

00:52:02.175 --> 00:52:03.967
Okay, let's talk about this first

00:52:04.223 --> 00:52:08.831
well thank you all
