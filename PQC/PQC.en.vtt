WEBVTT

00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:05.422
Today I mainly talk about the
safety education and training of PQC

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:14.336
I hope to finish in 20 minutes and leave 20
minutes for everyone to watch some videos

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:20.327
In the catalog, we can
see that our PQC laboratory

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.040
is actually divided
into two departments

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:29.440
One is the reliability laboratory
and the FA failure analysis laboratory

00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:32.669
The reliability lab will talk
a little bit about some of

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:35.840
the projects that we have
done some analysis on and then

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:39.242
Analyze the points that
should be paid attention to in

00:00:39.254 --> 00:00:42.240
the project and some ways
of personnel certification

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:45.413
The first ones that
will focus on FA are

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.640
X-Ray operations and
chemical room management

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.841
Chemical management will
introduce the environment as well

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:55.040
as education and training and
personal protective equipment

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:58.824
As well as the main chemical
spill handling procedures and

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:02.735
some life-saving hexafluorocarbons
and Diphoterine introduced

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:07.840
I will also watch the related
videos, and I will show us at the end.

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:11.680
Some occupational safety
cases in the PQC field

00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:21.883
In the words of the reliability
laboratory, there are some analysis below

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:26.585
Do HTOL, HAST, THB,
many, this is just an

00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:31.067
excerpt, there are many
different assignments

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:34.789
The reliability results are
mainly obtained through different

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.391
conditions such as temperature,
humidity, pressure and bias.

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:41.586
So why do you need reliability?

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.166
We often buy electrical appliances
outside, and we encounter

00:01:44.178 --> 00:01:46.660
that we have a warranty of
several years for several years.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:49.093
I believe everyone
knows that the warranty

00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:51.693
has been done very
accurately for a few years

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:54.036
now. If the warranty
is two years, it may

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.669
break in one day or one
month after two years.

00:01:56.694 --> 00:01:59.040
Reliability is doing this

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:05.696
There must be our technician
operators to do these experiments.

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:12.096
For personnel, it is defined according
to this file in the job management.

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:17.984
Relevant SOP-related
matters needing attention

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:28.480
In these SOPs, it will be
said that in fact, our work box

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:34.880
Some conditions of temperature,
humidity, pressure and voltage that are in

00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:41.710
After completing the experiment, we have to
operate the oven if there is a temperature

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:44.864
The working box of the
oven must confirm that

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:48.085
the temperature must be
lower than 50 degrees C

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.377
If you turn on the pressure
later, you have to wait

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.576
until the pointer of his
pressure gauge drops to 0.

00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:58.688
Open it again or it may explode.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.814
Of course it must be
turned off if the voltage is

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.885
You can see some below

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:08.124
Gloves, earmuffs and
gloves means that the

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:11.744
temperature of the product
may be relatively high.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.070
Be careful to avoid burns when handling

00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:18.011
If the earmuffs are due to some work

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:21.606
The noise in the room
where different instruments are

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.800
placed is very loud. The
purpose of wearing earmuffs is to

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:28.127
Avoid hearing damage

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:31.200
the same if you encounter some

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:37.344
If there is an emergency, press the
emergency button to avoid some accidents

00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:46.132
Reliability Lab and their personnel
are certified through the e-skill system

00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:53.618
Personnel can perform homework
only after passing classes and exams

00:03:53.643 --> 00:04:00.640
That simply took the way through
that reliability lab for some of their work

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:06.537
Next is the part of the FA
failure analysis laboratory

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:09.306
FA analysis is
mainly divided into

00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:13.019
non-destructive analysis
and destructive analysis

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:16.854
Non-destructive analysis,
as the name implies,

00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:20.607
we will not do something
to the product itself

00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:27.007
Let it damage the actions just exampled
like visual inspection, X-Ray lots and lots

00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:30.230
In terms of destructive
analysis, everyone most

00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:33.407
often knows that it is
decap opening, cross-section

00:04:37.247 --> 00:04:40.307
Relatively the same, our
FA operators must also

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.391
go through some
certification before they can go

00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:49.006
Doing these jobs says we
are managing through Power BI

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:56.191
Power BI has a lot of detailed
items Icon on the following side

00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:59.399
Personnel have to go through
some of us and have to go

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:02.591
through these skill owner
certifications. We will be there.

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:09.437
We have one of their

00:05:09.462 --> 00:05:12.884
Confident sheet You have
to give a score to say how

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:16.263
many points you achieved
to perform this assignment

00:05:16.288 --> 00:05:21.791
This is the part where
our FA will certify personnel

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:27.167
Then what comes next is

00:05:27.423 --> 00:05:32.287
The first topic is our X-Ray
manipulation of ionizing radiation

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.808
Everyone knows that if you
want to get the X-Ray operation

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.943
qualification in the factory,
we need to go to the first one.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.472
Apply for a special health
checkup Go to the hospital

00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:45.343
to apply for a checkup
and complete the checkup

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.659
After you come back, you will
have to consult an occupational

00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.743
doctor to see if your physical
condition can handle this work.

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:58.143
After passing it, we are going to sign up
for the 18-hour ionizing radiation course.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.191
last year's

00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:06.847
That's because we now have some ionizing
radiation personnel in the factory.

00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:09.151
comparison is

00:06:09.407 --> 00:06:13.759
Don't have so many people,
so it's basically once a year

00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:21.695
I have been in class recently and
the card is very tight. If you pass

00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.142
After the 18-hour ionizing
radiation course, the

00:06:25.154 --> 00:06:28.095
owner will teach the
operation of the machine

00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:34.495
After everything is ok, the owner
will apply for the X-Ray dose armband

00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:40.895
The dose armband is down here
so you can go qualify for X-Ray

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:48.249
Remember that once you get the dose armband
you have to log your procedure every month

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:53.951
If the production line is to brush
the bar code, then we have a PQC.

00:06:54.207 --> 00:07:00.217
Sign keeping system is the use
of the sign-in machine. We use that

00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:03.423
to record and report

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:09.823
Now, I don't know why it has
been received since last month.

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:14.687
That test record from our dose armband

00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:19.115
I didn't announce it again
before. I don't know why

00:07:19.127 --> 00:07:23.391
it should be changed to let
relevant people know now.

00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:41.626
So I asked about the
five-year cumulative amount,

00:08:41.638 --> 00:08:44.799
some of which are 0.13
and 0.23, that should be okay.

00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:23.455
Now because of the environmental safety
and security, these are sent every month.

00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:29.724
The test records will also be
forwarded to the relevant personnel

00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:34.603
The next introduction
is the management of

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:37.791
our chemical room,
which is mainly seen first.

00:09:38.047 --> 00:09:39.348
Environment introduction

00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:43.482
The chemical analysis room
is located in the PQC laboratory

00:09:43.494 --> 00:09:47.507
on the 2nd floor of C5, which
is the chemical analysis room.

00:09:47.532 --> 00:09:50.832
Then we put chemical protective
clothing, protective masks

00:09:50.844 --> 00:09:54.043
and non-slip shoes on the
cabinet in front and hang them.

00:09:54.068 --> 00:09:59.410
It's a hazmat suit with
shoes and a hat on the side

00:10:00.063 --> 00:10:03.202
There are mainly these equipments
in the chemical room. One

00:10:03.214 --> 00:10:06.207
room is a body flushing and
eyewash equipment. This is in

00:10:06.463 --> 00:10:09.279
Our improvement last
year included a curtain

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:14.074
On the one hand to avoid
splashing when an accident

00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:18.239
happens to spray you on
the other hand is privacy

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:23.871
Next to that there is an area
where we hang our gloves

00:10:24.383 --> 00:10:27.555
We have a rule that all
personnel should not wear gloves

00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:30.527
to touch the outside if they
leave the chemical room.

00:10:30.783 --> 00:10:36.927
instrument phone or desk or product
or anything to avoid other do not know

00:10:37.183 --> 00:10:42.303
If you touch the acid, it
will cause some injuries

00:10:42.627 --> 00:10:49.815
Then there is an emergency button above
the fume cupboard in our chemical room.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.103
The purpose of setting that panic
button is to say that if something happens

00:10:55.359 --> 00:11:01.503
In case of acid dumping or personal
injury we press this panic button our FA

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:04.546
There will be an alarm
bell in the office, and the

00:11:04.558 --> 00:11:07.647
relevant personnel will go
to the emergency disposal

00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:15.839
Then next is the storage
cabinet for our acid bottle.

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:19.155
After connecting to
the ventilation, I will

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:22.239
introduce the other
site because of storage.

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:27.615
Inappropriate acid bottle
causing his acid bottle to explode

00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:34.527
This is my storage cabinet and that
storage area for alcohol and acetone has

00:11:34.783 --> 00:11:38.111
Pack a leak-proof bucket
to keep him from tipping

00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:41.488
On the road of the
warehouse, there are hexafluoro

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.511
Diphoterine, which are mainly for the

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:48.332
Hydrofluoric acid or other acids
and bases can be used for emergency

00:11:48.344 --> 00:11:52.129
treatment after spraying, so I will
introduce a little later in the video

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:56.831
MSDS also has two groups in the laboratory

00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:59.871
One group inside the lab
One group outside the lab

00:12:02.431 --> 00:12:08.575
What needs to be done to get the
operation of the chemistry room through our

00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:14.629
Our person in charge of physical
property analysis carried out a 3-hour

00:12:15.231 --> 00:12:18.802
Hazard education training
and after-class exams can only

00:12:18.814 --> 00:12:22.396
be operated if a passing
score of 85 or more is required.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.216
In the same way, we also
target mothers according

00:12:25.228 --> 00:12:27.775
to the provisions of the
Occupational Safety Law.

00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:31.195
The protected part is
also for pregnant women

00:12:31.207 --> 00:12:34.175
or those who have
given birth and are still

00:12:34.431 --> 00:12:40.575
If you're breastfeeding, we'll
assign him to work. Don't go.

00:12:40.831 --> 00:12:46.975
Use the chemistry room and then don't
do anything with X-Ray but only if you

00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:50.341
It must be brought up. Don't
be afraid. After you bring it up,

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.375
you can go to the environmental
safety and health department.

00:12:53.631 --> 00:12:56.999
To apply for that armband
in a pregnancy to avoid

00:12:57.011 --> 00:13:00.391
others but I don't know
why they will pat the back

00:13:00.724 --> 00:13:03.103
is a protection

00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:10.783
The following words are the textbook and
the content that will be introduced in it

00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:19.489
So this is our personal protective
equipment before entering the chemical room

00:13:19.514 --> 00:13:25.302
Wear protective clothing,
wear a mask, wear a face shield

00:13:25.327 --> 00:13:28.014
Then the gloves and
shoes are made of acid-proof

00:13:28.026 --> 00:13:30.890
material. In fact, we have
changed several versions.

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:34.847
It took a lot of work to find this.

00:13:37.663 --> 00:13:43.807
Then you can see our
chemical processing procedures

00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:49.489
We used to practice this
twice a year. At that time,

00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:53.147
the regulations were changed
to practice once a year.

00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:55.583
Mainly still

00:13:56.607 --> 00:13:59.955
When the personnel operate in
the chemical room and find that

00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:03.435
they accidentally knock down
the acid bottle, it is a simulation

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.151
We're going to hit that emergency switch

00:14:09.407 --> 00:14:16.831
If the relevant personnel will come in
fully armed with C-type protective clothing

00:14:17.087 --> 00:14:20.113
He's going to get that
acid absorbent cotton

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:23.231
and that bag, and
that's the first thing to do

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:26.601
The leaking place is surrounded
by the outside and slowly

00:14:26.613 --> 00:14:29.631
absorbs him. After the
adsorption, he will also use that

00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:36.031
Use that clean water to wipe the
contaminated acid-absorbing cotton

00:14:36.287 --> 00:14:39.871
Put the wipes in that protective bag

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:44.700
The main introduction
here is that he must wear a

00:14:44.712 --> 00:14:48.063
protective mask when wearing
the C-type protective clothing.

00:14:48.319 --> 00:14:51.903
gas mask

00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:58.047
The same are gloves, clothes and
shoes are acid and alkali resistant.

00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:06.495
Well, here is what we will tell
the people in the group about us.

00:15:06.751 --> 00:15:10.415
The content of the drill
and let them know what to

00:15:10.427 --> 00:15:14.175
do in the event of an
emergency. They also signed in

00:15:14.687 --> 00:15:20.831
The next thing I saw was that
it was in the chemistry room.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:27.231
We now have one, two, three, four or five
of the fume cupboards in the chemical room.

00:15:27.487 --> 00:15:32.083
There is an emergency button on each seat

00:15:32.107 --> 00:15:35.186
In the event of an accident,
the emergency button is pressed

00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:41.710
We have an alarm bell in
the PQC office, the FA office

00:15:41.735 --> 00:15:43.964
He will ring and ring
that loudly, so the

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:46.431
relevant people will
hurry up and deal with it

00:15:48.223 --> 00:15:53.222
Next is the introduction of
hexafluorine and Diphoterine

00:15:53.389 --> 00:16:00.039
Hexafluorine is a neutralizing agent
for being sprayed with hydrofluoric acid

00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:07.167
Diphoterine is for some acids and
bases if accidentally splashed on the skin

00:16:07.423 --> 00:16:13.270
Hurry up and spray this to deal
with to avoid your more serious injury

00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:18.431
This is what I took from that
website yesterday, that is to say

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:22.015
This is the technology
factory in Tainan last year

00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:28.415
His employee got sprayed with
that hydrofluoric acid in the abdomen

00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:30.463
medical staff use that

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:38.143
Use that hexafluorine to
help him deal with it first

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.094
this in 2020

00:16:40.118 --> 00:16:42.258
Before this, I remember
that I think everyone should

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.543
have heard that there was
an electronics factory before.

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:50.431
The foreign worker spattered on his
thigh when he was making hydrofluoric acid

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:54.161
As a result, he was sent to the
hospital and he was clearly conscious, but

00:16:54.173 --> 00:16:57.490
the area was too large for him later
because no immediate treatment was done.

00:16:57.515 --> 00:17:00.671
So he left behind

00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:04.511
next

00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:13.215
can buy

00:17:13.727 --> 00:17:15.263
Hydrofluoric acid

00:17:17.823 --> 00:17:20.639
I don't know if I can buy it or not.

00:17:31.391 --> 00:17:33.439
I don't know this

00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:39.647
Let me talk about our work-related
injury case first, because

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:42.655
if the film is to be played,
I will wait for the last time.

00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:51.098
This is where we used to call the
RQC staff in that chemistry room

00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:56.479
The operation said that the
eye was burned as a result

00:17:56.735 --> 00:17:58.271
in 2012

00:17:58.849 --> 00:18:02.537
This is because we did not have
better protective equipment at

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:06.425
that time, and we wore half of
the acid-proof gloves at that time.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:12.265
Then we are wearing
goggles when we often drip acid

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.727
The head will stick into the fume
hood because the fume hood sometimes

00:18:17.983 --> 00:18:20.031
There will be some crystals

00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:23.312
The white crystals
fell off by accident and

00:18:23.324 --> 00:18:26.431
fell right next to his
eyes, he felt tingling

00:18:26.687 --> 00:18:34.367
So hurry up and respond to the supervisor,
we will deal with it as soon as possible

00:18:34.623 --> 00:18:37.939
Eliminate the evacuation
and send it to the doctor,

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.767
and then change the
way to improve it later.

00:18:41.023 --> 00:18:47.167
Helmet mask, but we've modified it to

00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:49.215
The way I just saw

00:18:51.775 --> 00:18:57.919
The other one is that in 2016
we have colleagues cutting that

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:02.271
What about the wires of the circuit board?

00:19:02.527 --> 00:19:05.599
I don't know what to do, just cut it off

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:13.023
So of course, I also did some first
aid actions and went to the back.

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:19.423
Send the doctor to Hai Zong
for stitches and injections

00:19:20.447 --> 00:19:26.591
Action said to wear gloves and
be careful when cutting things

00:19:29.407 --> 00:19:32.991
then this is

00:19:33.503 --> 00:19:39.647
What happened last year is that our
personnel were in our basement in the setup

00:19:39.903 --> 00:19:42.466
What about doing some electrical tests?

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:48.156
Because our machine is arranged like
this, we have to put up a lot of equipment

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.447
Accidentally tripped over
a wire and injured my jaw

00:19:52.703 --> 00:19:58.335
Then I went to the doctor

00:19:59.103 --> 00:20:04.608
So our later action correction method is

00:20:04.632 --> 00:20:11.647
Put these small instruments on racks to
avoid having too many wires on the ground

00:20:11.903 --> 00:20:14.719
tripping injuries

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:22.143
This one is what happened
last year, it's our personnel.

00:20:22.399 --> 00:20:24.959
doing

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:31.359
He was the maintenance guy and was
doing maintenance behind the machine

00:20:31.615 --> 00:20:37.759
Because I accidentally bumped into that

00:20:38.527 --> 00:20:44.671
The corner of the box will
create a hole in the head

00:20:44.927 --> 00:20:51.071
That is also a two or three days
of self-cultivation and sewing, so in

00:20:51.327 --> 00:20:55.423
This later becomes

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:00.208
He said that the box
can not be installed on

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.359
the walking line to avoid
collision so the back

00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:09.759
All of these have to be added to the
SOP. In fact, you still have to be careful.

00:21:10.015 --> 00:21:16.159
We are next door. This is the next
department. Their instruments are full.

00:21:16.416 --> 00:21:21.536
A lot of these boxes will hang on that wall

00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:30.240
That's what happened last
year, and this case means that

00:21:30.496 --> 00:21:33.493
At that time, there was a
new employee who went

00:21:33.505 --> 00:21:36.640
to our top-floor warehouse
with a more senior one.

00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:44.469
I didn't know why I put a fan on
that chair when I was finishing things.

00:21:44.494 --> 00:21:49.440
Because it's hot there, I turn on the fan

00:21:49.696 --> 00:21:52.692
The fan was shaking
when it turned because the

00:21:52.704 --> 00:21:55.840
chair was unstable and
it was about to fall over.

00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:59.412
Then this newcomer is
the fan blade of the electric

00:21:59.424 --> 00:22:02.240
fan when he picks up
the hand with his hand.

00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:08.640
Cut to the wound and bleed through our
environmental security guards to go there

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:11.791
I went to see the
problem and said that the

00:22:11.803 --> 00:22:15.040
first fan other than this
one cannot be placed in

00:22:15.296 --> 00:22:21.440
This unstable chair and his
wiring are also not quite right.

00:22:21.696 --> 00:22:23.232
there may be

00:22:23.488 --> 00:22:31.424
The risk of injury, plus his
extension cord, is also a mess.

00:22:32.192 --> 00:22:38.336
Then the request said that the fan
needs to be covered with a net later.

00:22:38.592 --> 00:22:41.682
If it is placed on the
ground and cannot be placed

00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:44.736
on the shelf, the power
cord should also be fixed.

00:22:44.992 --> 00:22:48.832
Pull down from above and fasten below

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.500
Well, this is roughly
what it means to say that

00:22:56.512 --> 00:22:59.584
this is also what happened
this year. This is in

00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:02.912
Malaysia KLM Laboratory

00:23:03.168 --> 00:23:09.312
The chemical laboratory in KLM
where they store acid bottles is normal

00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:16.480
The general file cabinet is sealed because

00:23:16.736 --> 00:23:20.224
What's wrong with the lack of
ventilation? After a period of time,

00:23:20.236 --> 00:23:23.736
he may have pressure build up
over there, and he suddenly exploded.

00:23:24.672 --> 00:23:30.816
At this time, they also came to
ask us how to store the acid bottle.

00:23:31.072 --> 00:23:36.704
Then, as mentioned above,
our acid bottle is placed in

00:23:37.216 --> 00:23:43.360
Put it in that vented box?

00:23:43.682 --> 00:23:47.175
And we have an acid bottle,
our tool owner will open the

00:23:47.187 --> 00:23:50.814
lid for him at a fixed time to
let him relieve the pressure

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.368
avoid it building up too much stress

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.304
Ok I'm probably like this and put it

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.376
The video of Hexafluorine and
Diphoterine for everyone to see

00:25:58.367 --> 00:26:00.678
Just look at the highlights
because it's over an hour

00:27:44.768 --> 00:27:47.298
What he's talking about is
that we are blown away by some

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.632
hydrofluoric acid or some
more toxic chemical liquid.

00:27:49.888 --> 00:27:52.983
After it penetrates
into the skin, its speed

00:27:52.995 --> 00:27:56.032
of eroding the skin
will also eat your cells

00:27:56.544 --> 00:28:02.688
Next, let's move on to the more
poisonous thing, which is TMAH.

00:28:02.944 --> 00:28:05.248
Some introduce some cases

00:31:10.514 --> 00:31:16.736
That TMAH he is a very
toxic solution before we

00:31:16.992 --> 00:31:23.136
The lab used to have it and it was
very poisonous so we've eliminated it

00:31:23.392 --> 00:31:26.701
He said that you only need
to be sprayed with this solution

00:31:26.713 --> 00:31:29.536
before the hexafluorine
and the Diphoterine appeared.

00:31:29.792 --> 00:31:30.914
you must be helpless

00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:34.114
behind this

00:31:34.144 --> 00:31:40.288
Hexafluorine and Diphoterine have a better
chance of survival after they appear.

00:31:41.122 --> 00:31:51.106
After him, I will show you some cases
that were sprayed with hydrofluoric acid.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:45.760
This is the foreign
labor incident last year.

00:38:46.784 --> 00:38:50.880
The patient just can't be
saved and just walks away

00:38:55.744 --> 00:39:00.608
Basically, just look around here.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:07.264
So knowing that means the chemistry
room is operating it has its dangers

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:13.664
But if you follow our
norms, it's actually ok.
